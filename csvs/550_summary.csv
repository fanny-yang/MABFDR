967,3,27,70,100,1.33,0.05328596381218923,550,There isn't much I can do. The opportunities for advancement are right in front of you.
967,7,19,74,100,1.33,0.060394327113353526,550,This is not a job for someone who puts himself first.
967,7,19,74,100,1.33,0.060394327113353526,550,Can those of you in the back of the room hear me all right?

967,8,17,75,100,1.33,0.06204429828352442,550,We need someone who can think inside the box.
967,7,19,74,100,1.33,0.060394327113353526,550,It's a negotiation trick I just learned from Trump.

987,7,18,73,98,1.3265306122448979,0.061154318437850894,550,"I meant it literally. Please, take a seat."
987,7,18,73,98,1.3265306122448979,0.061154318437850894,550,The arrangement is a metaphor - now get over it

1187,6,18,72,96,1.3125,0.0598105561885103,550,My strength is that I am a back seat driver.
1187,8,14,74,96,1.3125,0.06337112215202614,550,Which of you would like to Chair our next fundraising event?

1187,4,22,70,96,1.3125,0.05602415675716037,550,That's the closest anyone has made it in the interview process so far.
1187,8,14,74,96,1.3125,0.06337112215202614,550,I understand you're the corporate analyst who claimed I'm a narrow-minded SOB.
1187,7,16,73,96,1.3125,0.061616563334812684,550,"So, why do you want to work for NASA, Mr. .... Neptune?"

1187,7,16,73,96,1.3125,0.061616563334812684,550,"No, that is NOT why they call me 'Chairman'."
1187,9,12,75,96,1.3125,0.06507839402152647,550,"SO, let me understand: Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy and Dopey are walking out to renegotiate and you're their lawyer, Mr. Sleazy?"
1187,6,18,72,96,1.3125,0.0598105561885103,550,You didn't say 'Donald may I?'
1187,3,24,69,96,1.3125,0.0540315453669136,550,I'm known throughout the industry for putting people first.
1187,5,20,71,96,1.3125,0.05794829062159566,550,We'll be boarding today's meeting starting from the rear of the cabin.
1187,3,24,69,96,1.3125,0.0540315453669136,550,"Yes , I would consider it a message."
1187,6,18,72,96,1.3125,0.0598105561885103,550,Young man in the back. Did you not read my ad? It clearly states I'm only hiring ghost writers.
1187,6,18,72,96,1.3125,0.0598105561885103,550,You just seem so distant lately!
1187,5,20,71,96,1.3125,0.05794829062159566,550,"As you can see, we offer many opportunities for a new employee to move up in the company."

1187,5,20,71,96,1.3125,0.05794829062159566,550,"I'm pretty sure the rules are when the music stops, we remove a chair."
1187,8,14,74,96,1.3125,0.06337112215202614,550,Just waiting for The Seven Deadly Sins to get here.

1187,6,18,72,96,1.3125,0.0598105561885103,550,Bob regretted not having upgraded to First Class.
1187,5,20,71,96,1.3125,0.05794829062159566,550,"You know, this company could use a man who takes a back seat to no one."
1187,6,18,72,96,1.3125,0.0598105561885103,550,So convince me you need to move to the next chair....
1187,6,18,72,96,1.3125,0.0598105561885103,550,"At our company, there are plenty of opportunities to get ahead."
1187,7,16,73,96,1.3125,0.061616563334812684,550,You are going to have to speak up.
1187,7,16,73,96,1.3125,0.061616563334812684,550,"From front to back, I'd like you to welcome Topper, Mrs. Muir, Casper, Sam Wheat, Jacob Marley, Dr. Malcolm Crowe and Hamlet's father."
1187,5,20,71,96,1.3125,0.05794829062159566,550,I have a thing about getting too close to my employees
1187,11,8,77,96,1.3125,0.06836515091513455,550,"This is why you must never, ever reply-all."
1187,4,22,70,96,1.3125,0.05602415675716037,550,"Yes, I see that. But you still have to wait your turn!!"
1187,5,20,71,96,1.3125,0.05794829062159566,550,Why must you always take a back seat to no one?
1187,4,22,70,96,1.3125,0.05602415675716037,550,"Alright, who's next?"
1187,5,20,71,96,1.3125,0.05794829062159566,550,This is not what I meant when I asked you to chair the meeting.
1187,7,16,73,96,1.3125,0.061616563334812684,550,I said shares!
1187,3,24,69,96,1.3125,0.0540315453669136,550,For every right answer to my questions you will advance forward one chair.
1187,6,18,72,96,1.3125,0.0598105561885103,550,My management style? I tend to lead from behind.
1187,7,16,73,96,1.3125,0.061616563334812684,550,I see on your resume that you have experience with office layout...
1187,6,18,72,96,1.3125,0.0598105561885103,550,"Well, Smith, let’s talk about Accounting’s rule that we all must fly Coach."
1187,5,20,71,96,1.3125,0.05794829062159566,550,"There, I created space for dissenting opinions!"
1187,7,16,73,96,1.3125,0.061616563334812684,550,Hmm. That is the correct spelling of 'succedaneum'. You may advance one chair.
1187,7,16,73,96,1.3125,0.061616563334812684,550,This puts climbing our corporate ladder in a more comfortable perspective.
1187,9,12,75,96,1.3125,0.06507839402152647,550,"Not very bright, are you?"
1187,6,18,72,96,1.3125,0.0598105561885103,550,"Why, yes, I used to work for Jet Blue. How did you know?"
1187,6,18,72,96,1.3125,0.0598105561885103,550,Eighth chair? It's like playing triangle in the high school band.
1187,4,22,70,96,1.3125,0.05602415675716037,550,WHO IS NEXT?
1187,6,18,72,96,1.3125,0.0598105561885103,550,Why is it that lawyers always choose the emergency exit row?
1241,7,16,74,97,1.309278350515464,0.06106307781414728,550,"Now, tell me how I sound from third in the front."
1242,4,21,69,94,1.3085106382978724,0.0566481507384142,550,"Don't worry, the other candidates are all very short."
1242,4,21,69,94,1.3085106382978724,0.0566481507384142,550,"So, Mr. Consultant, just how would you reorganize things here at Caboose, International?"
1242,4,21,69,94,1.3085106382978724,0.0566481507384142,550,Let's make this quick. I've got a long line of people after this.
1242,7,15,72,94,1.3085106382978724,0.062412777380097484,550,I'm sorry. You'll have to place your carry-on under the seat in front of you.
1242,6,17,71,94,1.3085106382978724,0.060552243400987533,550,"Donald, you are far and away the best candidate for the job."
1242,2,25,67,94,1.3085106382978724,0.052454282792463724,550,Fortunately for you the curse only extended to the seventh son.
1242,7,15,72,94,1.3085106382978724,0.062412777380097484,550,"Since you ask, the other seven auditors are currently in witness protection."
1242,4,21,69,94,1.3085106382978724,0.0566481507384142,550,As for you...

2822,3,9,63,75,1.2,0.05694947974514994,550,Well...we found that 'status seating' is much clearer than with a round table.
2822,3,9,63,75,1.2,0.05694947974514994,550,While we find your resume truly inspiring your bad breath will make office design a big challenge.

2822,0,15,60,75,1.2,0.04649905549752771,550,"Okay, now I'd like you to come up here, but pretend the floor is lava...go!"

2822,3,9,63,75,1.2,0.05694947974514994,550,More proof that real life really is a lot like high school.
2822,4,7,64,75,1.2,0.06003002251876642,550,"If you sat a little closer, I wouldn't have to yell!"

2822,3,9,63,75,1.2,0.05694947974514994,550,My dream is so close yet so far.
2822,3,9,63,75,1.2,0.05694947974514994,550,In lieu of the raise I requested I'd like to have some peanuts and a pillow.
2822,3,9,63,75,1.2,0.05694947974514994,550,Can we get you some peanuts and a cup of soda?
2822,2,11,62,75,1.2,0.05369248441712195,550,The rest of my desks are getting delivered tomorrow.
2822,2,11,62,75,1.2,0.05369248441712195,550,"Next year, Jones, I have every confidence that you will earn one of the front seven seats. Dismissed."
2822,2,11,62,75,1.2,0.05369248441712195,550,"Well I'm glad all the Chairs are aligned on this issue, Harris."
2822,3,9,63,75,1.2,0.05694947974514994,550,I said succession planning would be a waste of time!
2822,1,13,61,75,1.2,0.050224720233392264,550,I'm here to represent Rudolph.
2822,1,13,61,75,1.2,0.050224720233392264,550,Now you can see why we don't allow big hats.
2822,3,9,63,75,1.2,0.05694947974514994,550,Now you know why they call me the chairman of the bored.
2822,2,11,62,75,1.2,0.05369248441712195,550,"Now do you understand why ""sitting in your chair"" is not a realistic answer to ""Where do you see yourself in five years?"""
2822,5,5,65,75,1.2,0.06296001877353567,550,"After our first Cabinet meeting last week, I accepted resignations from those who opposed my suggestion to add me to Mount Rushmore to motivate everyone to make America great again. Since you were absent, you may vote on my idea by secret ballot."
2822,3,9,63,75,1.2,0.05694947974514994,550,"I tell you, perspective is greatly undervalued."
2822,1,13,61,75,1.2,0.050224720233392264,550,A faster line just opened up in the next room.
2822,3,9,63,75,1.2,0.05694947974514994,550,"So, um... Can I get a large fountain drink and some peanuts down here?"
2822,3,9,63,75,1.2,0.05694947974514994,550,"I don't get it, how can a company suffer from too much linear thinking?"
2822,3,9,63,75,1.2,0.05694947974514994,550,I don't have an appointment until 5:00 o'clock.
2822,3,9,63,75,1.2,0.05694947974514994,550,At least I'm in the room where it happens.

2822,2,11,62,75,1.2,0.05369248441712195,550,You just need to wait your turn.
2822,1,13,61,75,1.2,0.050224720233392264,550,"One day, son, one of these chairs will be yours."
2822,1,13,61,75,1.2,0.050224720233392264,550,You in the back will have to wait your turn. I can only see one chair at a time.
2822,2,11,62,75,1.2,0.05369248441712195,550,You are number 8 in line. Would you rather leave a call-back number?
2822,4,7,64,75,1.2,0.06003002251876642,550,"Yes. I think you've the perfect look for our live, studio audience."
2822,2,11,62,75,1.2,0.05369248441712195,550,"Bob, you have to stop taking a back seat to life."
2822,2,11,62,75,1.2,0.05369248441712195,550,"Young man back there, is it true that your way of dealing with the competition is by eliminating it?"
2822,2,11,62,75,1.2,0.05369248441712195,550,"It all comes down to perspective, doesn't it?"
2822,3,9,63,75,1.2,0.05694947974514994,550,Please be patient. We're looking for some other employees and a record player.
2822,1,13,61,75,1.2,0.050224720233392264,550,"So, Peterson, how does it feel to be a member of a visible minority?"
2822,3,9,63,75,1.2,0.05694947974514994,550,My great grandfather built this company on the principle of integrity. I added Tetris.
2822,2,11,62,75,1.2,0.05369248441712195,550,"And how, Mr. Smith, do see 'musical chairs' as being an asset to this firm?"
2822,4,7,64,75,1.2,0.06003002251876642,550,Now do you understand? I am the Chairman!
2822,1,13,61,75,1.2,0.050224720233392264,550,Being 8th in line is not so bad when my competition is nonexistent.
2822,4,7,64,75,1.2,0.06003002251876642,550,"Our name might be La-z-boy Chairs, but our game is Musical Chairs . . . congratulations, you nailed it!"

2822,0,15,60,75,1.2,0.04649905549752771,550,"Phelps, I'm glad to see someone shares my narrow focus for our future."
2822,3,9,63,75,1.2,0.05694947974514994,550,"My previous aides were great, I hope that one day you will fill their space."
2822,2,11,62,75,1.2,0.05369248441712195,550,"Stevens, you're a long shot for chairman."
2822,2,11,62,75,1.2,0.05369248441712195,550,"No, I said last in, first out!"
2822,1,13,61,75,1.2,0.050224720233392264,550,Have I not made myself clear? Please raise your hand before speaking.
2822,1,13,61,75,1.2,0.050224720233392264,550,"""Will you sit in the front if I pull the drapes?"
2822,3,9,63,75,1.2,0.05694947974514994,550,Please remain seated until I turn off the Fasten Seat Belt sign.
