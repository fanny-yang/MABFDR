2143,4,13,77,94,1.2234042553191489,0.052731943044405004,552,Global warming has screwed us both.
2143,4,13,77,94,1.2234042553191489,0.052731943044405004,552,"Oh no, you've sprung a leak ."

2143,3,15,76,94,1.2234042553191489,0.05051610849850969,552,"Mum sent you, didn't she! Well, tell her I'm not going back with you or anyone!"
2143,2,17,75,94,1.2234042553191489,0.04819851261634567,552,And here I believed climate change was a hoax.
2143,4,13,77,94,1.2234042553191489,0.052731943044405004,552,Merrily Merrily Merrily Merrily life is but a dream
2143,3,15,76,94,1.2234042553191489,0.05051610849850969,552,From now on I'm not pushing you up the hills.

2143,5,11,78,94,1.2234042553191489,0.0548583486503517,552,"Michael, it's just a song; it wasn't a request."
2143,4,13,77,94,1.2234042553191489,0.052731943044405004,552,"Since climate change, is this the Atlantic or the Pacific?"
2143,3,15,76,94,1.2234042553191489,0.05051610849850969,552,"Take your damn ""merrily, merrily, merrily"" somewhere else."

2143,4,13,77,94,1.2234042553191489,0.052731943044405004,552,My boat capsized. Can I hitch a ride with you?
2143,3,15,76,94,1.2234042553191489,0.05051610849850969,552,"Look, I'm not going to pretend to swim so we can both ""feel better"" about this!"
2143,5,11,78,94,1.2234042553191489,0.0548583486503517,552,A triathlon usually involves water.
2143,4,13,77,94,1.2234042553191489,0.052731943044405004,552,Why didn't we just stay on the Arc?
2143,5,11,78,94,1.2234042553191489,0.0548583486503517,552,"If I promise to help bail, will you let me in?"
2143,4,13,77,94,1.2234042553191489,0.052731943044405004,552,Is that the surge price or standard fare?
2143,5,11,78,94,1.2234042553191489,0.0548583486503517,552,"...Merrilly, merrily, merrily, merrilly - just doesn't cut it for me anymore."

2143,5,11,78,94,1.2234042553191489,0.0548583486503517,552,Stroke!
2143,3,15,76,94,1.2234042553191489,0.05051610849850969,552,Watch out! You're making waves!
2143,3,15,76,94,1.2234042553191489,0.05051610849850969,552,You went in a circle again?!
2143,2,17,75,94,1.2234042553191489,0.04819851261634567,552,Do you have any water?
2143,4,13,77,94,1.2234042553191489,0.052731943044405004,552,Luckily I don't believe in climate change.
2143,3,15,76,94,1.2234042553191489,0.05051610849850969,552,Is the Styx always so low this time of year Charon?
2143,3,15,76,94,1.2234042553191489,0.05051610849850969,552,Still no sign of water?
2143,3,15,76,94,1.2234042553191489,0.05051610849850969,552,"'I think I'll skip my turn."""
2143,3,15,76,94,1.2234042553191489,0.05051610849850969,552,I said we are in the same boat! I did not mean get one!
2143,4,13,77,94,1.2234042553191489,0.052731943044405004,552,"Michael, DON'T row the boat ashore."
2143,4,13,77,94,1.2234042553191489,0.052731943044405004,552,"If you're not from Guinness World Records, get the hell off my casserole!"
2143,5,11,78,94,1.2234042553191489,0.0548583486503517,552,"for the 100th time, it is just a mirage- Now let's cut our losses and leave the boat behind!"
2143,2,17,75,94,1.2234042553191489,0.04819851261634567,552,"Well, I don't think you're making any better time than I am in that thing."
2143,4,13,77,94,1.2234042553191489,0.052731943044405004,552,You must be imagining things.
2143,3,15,76,94,1.2234042553191489,0.05051610849850969,552,When's it gonna be my turn to row?
2143,6,9,79,94,1.2234042553191489,0.056905351383228574,552,So that darned Moses has been through here?
2143,2,17,75,94,1.2234042553191489,0.04819851261634567,552,"Hey, not fair, where can I get one of those?"
2143,3,15,76,94,1.2234042553191489,0.05051610849850969,552,Per chance are you going my way?
2143,3,15,76,94,1.2234042553191489,0.05051610849850969,552,Keep going - you're making good time. But stop splashing sand in my face!
2143,3,15,76,94,1.2234042553191489,0.05051610849850969,552,The sea level will be rising any minute now!
2143,5,11,78,94,1.2234042553191489,0.0548583486503517,552,You said we were going to be heroes Noah
2143,4,13,77,94,1.2234042553191489,0.052731943044405004,552,Canada or Mexico?
2143,6,9,79,94,1.2234042553191489,0.056905351383228574,552,"If you sing ""Row your boat"" one more time I will gently put that oar ..."
2143,4,13,77,94,1.2234042553191489,0.052731943044405004,552,"I told you, you couldn’t escape climate change."
2143,4,13,77,94,1.2234042553191489,0.052731943044405004,552,I still say there is no such thing as global warming!
2143,4,13,77,94,1.2234042553191489,0.052731943044405004,552,Is that you George or am I hallucinating?
2143,4,13,77,94,1.2234042553191489,0.052731943044405004,552,I lost my fins.
2143,3,15,76,94,1.2234042553191489,0.05051610849850969,552,This was easier before global warming.
2143,4,13,77,94,1.2234042553191489,0.052731943044405004,552,"Oh good, I was hoping this was surreal experience."
2143,3,15,76,94,1.2234042553191489,0.05051610849850969,552,We are on land. Just call it right or left.
2143,3,15,76,94,1.2234042553191489,0.05051610849850969,552,"I thought I was the greatest fool in the world, but then of course, I saw an oar out of the corner of my eye."
2143,3,15,76,94,1.2234042553191489,0.05051610849850969,552,Which one of us is the mirage.
2143,3,15,76,94,1.2234042553191489,0.05051610849850969,552,I guess pleading for water at this point might seem superfluous.
2143,4,13,77,94,1.2234042553191489,0.052731943044405004,552,Oh sure. Make me do all the crawling.
2143,5,11,78,94,1.2234042553191489,0.0548583486503517,552,You're the third person that's told me I was *their* mirage.
2143,5,11,78,94,1.2234042553191489,0.0548583486503517,552,"Seventy percent of the earth's surface is covered with water. What, exactly, did you type into the Sat Nav this time?"
2143,3,15,76,94,1.2234042553191489,0.05051610849850969,552,I never realized I was such a good swimmer.

2143,4,13,77,94,1.2234042553191489,0.052731943044405004,552,"For Pete's sake, would you slow down and let me in!"
2143,5,11,78,94,1.2234042553191489,0.0548583486503517,552,"You've overachieved again, Michael."
2249,5,11,79,95,1.2210526315789474,0.05432873965604114,552,I told you we should have stayed in the water.
2249,2,17,76,95,1.2210526315789474,0.047746407774967206,552,"Have you no honor, man! It's women and children first."

2249,5,11,79,95,1.2210526315789474,0.05432873965604114,552,Maybe we should have gone to starboard back there.
2249,3,15,77,95,1.2210526315789474,0.050036822652392024,552,"Noah....listen, you're never going to need that boat."

3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,You'll die of heat stroke if you keep that up!
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,"Hey, stop edging me off the road."
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,"IF I hear you sing Row, row, row your boat one more time..."
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,Who would think the sea completely loses its liquidity?!
3593,0,11,68,79,1.139240506329114,0.03919912801985522,552,You gonna offer me a ride oar what?
3593,3,5,71,79,1.139240506329114,0.050102709228008094,552,"Why did it have to be a desert, island?"
3593,3,5,71,79,1.139240506329114,0.050102709228008094,552,"Hey, share the desert!"
3593,3,5,71,79,1.139240506329114,0.050102709228008094,552,Merrily merrily merrily merrily - my life is but a meme.
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,"I am tired of arguing, but you still enjoy a public row, don't you, Fred?"
3593,4,3,72,79,1.139240506329114,0.05324332274388439,552,I told you I don't know how to swim. Hand me the oar already.
3593,3,5,71,79,1.139240506329114,0.050102709228008094,552,So where’s all the press you promised?
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,Stop sticking your oar in my business!
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,"Oh sure, merrily, merrily row your boat."
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,And I thought I was in the throws of dementia!
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,We have to be ready when the big one comes on shore.
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,"When I said we could use ""a ship of the desert"" this is not what I had in mind. . ."""
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,Yeah it is one helluva mirage but is it yours or mine?
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,You chose the luxury package.
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,"I admit you warned me it was going to be slow, but even so, shouldn't we be in China by now??"
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,"Geez, okay, you used to be a professional rower. WE GET IT."
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,You're not fooling anyone.
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,Not that ship of the desert!
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,I ordered a mirage over 3 hours ago
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,I’m afraid the Court will overturn Row.
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,Serves you right for throwing the coxswain overboard!
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,"Call me a pessimist if you want, but life isn’t “but a dream” no matter how many times you sing it."
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,I think you've sprung a leak.
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,We were supposed to switch three dunes ago.
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,"I'd consider being your coxswain...but, a comprehensive health insurance policy is non-negotiable."
3593,0,11,68,79,1.139240506329114,0.03919912801985522,552,I could use that bottle of rum
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,You're all wet!
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,Rowed all that way and forgot the life preserver?
3593,0,11,68,79,1.139240506329114,0.03919912801985522,552,"If you need help with your canal, I'm your man, I know every inch of this island."
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,Hey! Stay in your own desert!
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,Are you texting? We should have reached Calais hours ago.
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,Does this place have a Stairmaster?
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,"Three days of maddening thirst, scorching heat , and a nincompoop singing ""row,row,row your boat""."
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,Captain! Captain! Man overboard!!
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,What in hell's name is your secret?
3593,3,5,71,79,1.139240506329114,0.050102709228008094,552,Got any gum?
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,"You said there wasn't enough room in the lifeboat. But guess what, you weren't too hard to follow!"
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,"Row, row, row your boat, my ass. If you hit me in the face one more time with the sand, we're changing places."
3593,0,11,68,79,1.139240506329114,0.03919912801985522,552,"I said, 'It's over.'"
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,I still think we should have just taken the river.
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,"No one rides for free, huh?"
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,The argument over global warning continues.
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,"I absolutely refuse to sing ""just one more round"" of ""Row, Row, Row Your Boat"" ."
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,I have to come aboard. This place is teeming with land sharks.
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,"I don't think singing helps, since we don't have a stream and we're not that merry."
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,Finish your mirage and we'll both feel better!
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,Hey! This stopped being an hallucination 10 miles ago.
3593,3,5,71,79,1.139240506329114,0.050102709228008094,552,I was wondering the same thing too.
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,"You've been asleep at the wheel again, haven't you?"
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,Are there any other survivers?
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,"Climate change is a bear, isn't it?"
3593,0,11,68,79,1.139240506329114,0.03919912801985522,552,Is that a rental?
3593,3,5,71,79,1.139240506329114,0.050102709228008094,552,Last weeks wave knocked me out of my boat.
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,I've always preferred kayaks.
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,Cheat!!
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,"Sure, as long as you are willing to row"
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,Will you relent and abandon ship!
3593,0,11,68,79,1.139240506329114,0.03919912801985522,552,I think I took a wrong turn...
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,Hello sailor; would you have a cold glass of juice for a fella?
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,Can you hear me now?
3593,3,5,71,79,1.139240506329114,0.050102709228008094,552,Got anything stronger than a 15 scented with Bronzer?
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,It must have been another mirage. Sorry.
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,"I was worried there for a minute, but things are looking great again."
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,Optimists always win.
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,Can I bum a ride my SUV ran out of gas a few miles back.
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,When are you going to realize this is a mirage?
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,Can we try another tune?
3593,3,5,71,79,1.139240506329114,0.050102709228008094,552,"Very funny, a-hole."
3593,3,5,71,79,1.139240506329114,0.050102709228008094,552,Hey...fuck you Fred!
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,"Hey! How about a ""playing through""?"
3593,0,11,68,79,1.139240506329114,0.03919912801985522,552,Quit with the merrilys already!
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,At least I can see that mirage ahead of us.
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,"Merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream!"
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,"Please, Michael...row the boat ashore. Hallelujah!"
3593,0,11,68,79,1.139240506329114,0.03919912801985522,552,"Remember, it's my turn when we hit the oasis!"
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,...but I got a great deal on this oceanfront property in Arizona!
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,"I hate to be a tidal bore, but wait six hours. This is the Bay of Fundy after all!"
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,For the last time! Let me row for awhile.
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,Your afraid I'll slow you down?
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,Sir all I asked is for you to rate how your service was.
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,"Oh sure...the Messiah can walk on water, but not hot sand."
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,The only wet spot is where I just wrote my name in the sand.
3593,3,5,71,79,1.139240506329114,0.050102709228008094,552,"OK, OK! I admit it's real, so please stop singing that song!"
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,Didn't you hear me singing hallelujah back at the shore?
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,Whaddya mean you're looking for dry land?!!!
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,I'm waiting for a sandstorm
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,Spare some change?
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,I told you! A wadi is a DRY riverbed.
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,Is there no situation in which you cannot be a hipster?
3593,0,11,68,79,1.139240506329114,0.03919912801985522,552,Don't you think your mirage expectations are a bit unrealistic?
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,Uber for Sam?
3593,4,3,72,79,1.139240506329114,0.05324332274388439,552,Welcome to Alaska!
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,Need a lift? It looks like we are both going nowhere.
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,Hitchhikers can be dangerous and Jason didn't want to take that risk.
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,"Not a rowboat, you idiot. We need a sandpan to get outta here."
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,TRY A DIFFERENT MIRAGE
3593,1,9,69,79,1.139240506329114,0.04314095017892059,552,"Man, I thought I was seeing mirages."
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,Last one at the lake is a rotten egg.
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,Please take me to the Oasis mirage.
3593,2,7,70,79,1.139240506329114,0.046751593846233924,552,How many more times - the tide is out!
3593,3,5,71,79,1.139240506329114,0.050102709228008094,552,"I'm not passive aggressive, like *some people*."
3825,3,5,72,80,1.1375,0.049503068566184395,552,Quit rowing our tour guide. It's just a mirage à trois.
3825,1,9,70,80,1.1375,0.042633817622437835,552,Why do you have to be such an idealist?
3825,1,9,70,80,1.1375,0.042633817622437835,552,"Yes, I do feel less foolish for believing this was not a mirage."
3825,1,9,70,80,1.1375,0.042633817622437835,552,You probably think that's funny.
