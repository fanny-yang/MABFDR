1240,7,14,79,100,1.28,0.05874099974042875,548,Is my brake light out?
1240,6,16,78,100,1.28,0.056995480947921194,548,"Honestly Officer, I would never text and drive."

1922,5,11,74,90,1.2333333333333334,0.05708263279047432,548,"Land speed record, no. Busted tail light, yes."

1922,4,13,73,90,1.2333333333333334,0.054851974222946666,548,"Officer, it's self driving!"
1922,3,15,72,90,1.2333333333333334,0.05252667118728806,548,"Don't you realize it's against the law to disconnect, modify or alter a required pollution control device?"
1922,5,11,74,90,1.2333333333333334,0.05708263279047432,548,"Really, officer? I could have sworn I was only doing 32,000mph."
1922,4,13,73,90,1.2333333333333334,0.054851974222946666,548,Sir ... are you aware you have a broken tail light?
1922,3,15,72,90,1.2333333333333334,0.05252667118728806,548,I guess you didn't see the Mars exit 3 miles back.
1922,2,17,71,90,1.2333333333333334,0.05009354545128693,548,"I'm sure it's an honest mistake, but the limit's 55, not 550."
1922,2,17,71,90,1.2333333333333334,0.05009354545128693,548,You have a broken drag chute light.
1922,6,9,75,90,1.2333333333333334,0.059229341178418174,548,You've got a tail light out.
1922,4,13,73,90,1.2333333333333334,0.054851974222946666,548,Elon who?
1922,3,15,72,90,1.2333333333333334,0.05252667118728806,548,"Just this once, I'm letting you off with a warning."
1922,2,17,71,90,1.2333333333333334,0.05009354545128693,548,"Your drivers license expires 3 light years ago, Captain Kirk."
1922,3,15,72,90,1.2333333333333334,0.05252667118728806,548,Do you have any idea how many barriers you just broke?

1922,4,13,73,90,1.2333333333333334,0.054851974222946666,548,You have a busted tail light.
1922,3,15,72,90,1.2333333333333334,0.05252667118728806,548,This is a no sonic boom zone.
1922,5,11,74,90,1.2333333333333334,0.05708263279047432,548,Did you notice you passed 45 stoplights?
1922,5,11,74,90,1.2333333333333334,0.05708263279047432,548,"Sammy, 'I Can't Drive 55' isn't a valid excuse."

1922,3,15,72,90,1.2333333333333334,0.05252667118728806,548,It's not your taillights. Your afterburners are out.
1922,1,19,70,90,1.2333333333333334,0.04753604322766905,548,It's not rocket science.
1922,4,13,73,90,1.2333333333333334,0.054851974222946666,548,Did you know you were missing a tail light?
1922,3,15,72,90,1.2333333333333334,0.05252667118728806,548,Firing your left afterburner does not constitute signaling a proper lane-change.
1922,4,13,73,90,1.2333333333333334,0.054851974222946666,548,Did you know your taillights melted?
1922,5,11,74,90,1.2333333333333334,0.05708263279047432,548,You match the description of a vehicle seen driving slowly past houses and looking into peoples' garages.
1922,2,17,71,90,1.2333333333333334,0.05009354545128693,548,One of your tail lights is burned out.
1922,4,13,73,90,1.2333333333333334,0.054851974222946666,548,"I have to tell you, this ticket is going to be ""huuuge""."

1922,5,11,74,90,1.2333333333333334,0.05708263279047432,548,You were ten miles over the sound barrier.
1922,5,11,74,90,1.2333333333333334,0.05708263279047432,548,Can I see your registration and pilot license?
1922,5,11,74,90,1.2333333333333334,0.05708263279047432,548,"License and flight insurance, please."
1922,7,7,76,90,1.2333333333333334,0.061300919622521086,548,"License, registration and penis."

1922,6,9,75,90,1.2333333333333334,0.059229341178418174,548,"When you left that last light you melted two Telsas and one Prius, which I personally think is pretty cool."
1922,5,11,74,90,1.2333333333333334,0.05708263279047432,548,Did you know that you were going 485 mph in a 30 mph zone?
1922,5,11,74,90,1.2333333333333334,0.05708263279047432,548,"While not brain surgery, using turn signals apparently outstrips rocket science."
1922,6,9,75,90,1.2333333333333334,0.059229341178418174,548,"Please don't tell my dad, it's his company car."
1922,4,13,73,90,1.2333333333333334,0.054851974222946666,548,No rearview mirror!
1922,5,11,74,90,1.2333333333333334,0.05708263279047432,548,"Yeah? Well, around here, buddy, we got a little thing we call 'The Speed of Light,' and we take it kind of serious."
1922,4,13,73,90,1.2333333333333334,0.054851974222946666,548,"Sir, your left tail light is out."
1922,2,17,71,90,1.2333333333333334,0.05009354545128693,548,"The speed limit is 25 MPH, and you were doing Warp Factor 9."
1922,6,9,75,90,1.2333333333333334,0.059229341178418174,548,Did you know your rear thruster light is out? .
1922,5,11,74,90,1.2333333333333334,0.05708263279047432,548,Were you aware that your tail light is out?

1922,4,13,73,90,1.2333333333333334,0.054851974222946666,548,What do you mean you only have a learners permit.
1922,5,11,74,90,1.2333333333333334,0.05708263279047432,548,I'm going to let you off with a warning.
1922,3,15,72,90,1.2333333333333334,0.05252667118728806,548,"Well fella, this is a warning ticket...your tail lights are out!"
1922,5,11,74,90,1.2333333333333334,0.05708263279047432,548,"You were going 1000 miles an hour in a 55 zone, but that's not why I pulled you over."
1922,2,17,71,90,1.2333333333333334,0.05009354545128693,548,"I appreciate your slowing to 325 in the school zone, but still."
1922,6,9,75,90,1.2333333333333334,0.059229341178418174,548,You need to replace your muffler.

2074,7,6,76,89,1.2247191011235956,0.06137846430699782,548,Tail light's out.
2074,2,16,71,89,1.2247191011235956,0.04990493769277266,548,It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that you were speeding.
2074,4,12,73,89,1.2247191011235956,0.054783464986671616,548,"Honestly officer, I couldn't have been speeding. I had it set to 60 on cruise missile control."
2074,3,14,72,89,1.2247191011235956,0.0524010059162293,548,I noticed you weren't wearing your ejection seat helmet there pal!
2074,4,12,73,89,1.2247191011235956,0.054783464986671616,548,"I'd guess you have really, really small hands?"
2074,5,10,74,89,1.2247191011235956,0.05706654581152649,548,"Ironically, you were going under the speed limit."
2074,5,10,74,89,1.2247191011235956,0.05706654581152649,548,You realize you were going 10 miles over Mach 1
2074,5,10,74,89,1.2247191011235956,0.05706654581152649,548,Don't tell me you didn't realize how fast you were going.

2074,4,12,73,89,1.2247191011235956,0.054783464986671616,548,Are you Elton John?
2074,4,12,73,89,1.2247191011235956,0.054783464986671616,548,We had a report of a science education being used in the area.
2074,4,12,73,89,1.2247191011235956,0.054783464986671616,548,You have burned out tail-lights.

2074,3,14,72,89,1.2247191011235956,0.0524010059162293,548,I'm relatively certain I wasn't speeding.
2074,2,16,71,89,1.2247191011235956,0.04990493769277266,548,"Is there a problem, officer? The sign said no pedestrians, bicyclists or equestrians."

2074,3,14,72,89,1.2247191011235956,0.0524010059162293,548,"Normally I'd say 'Where's the fire?', but it just melted my dashboard."
2074,4,12,73,89,1.2247191011235956,0.054783464986671616,548,I heard the divorce went well.
2074,7,6,76,89,1.2247191011235956,0.06137846430699782,548,"Sir, if you're going to drive under the speed limit you have to stay in the right lane"

2074,5,10,74,89,1.2247191011235956,0.05706654581152649,548,This ticket is for going past the speed of light.
2074,7,6,76,89,1.2247191011235956,0.06137846430699782,548,You realize that you were exceeding the space time continuum theory by 5 miles per hour don't you?
2074,5,10,74,89,1.2247191011235956,0.05706654581152649,548,"Well, touch down is bringing you around to find a $400 fine and 5 points on your license, Rocket Man..."
2074,2,16,71,89,1.2247191011235956,0.04990493769277266,548,I had you at Mach 10 in a Mach 2 zone.

2074,4,12,73,89,1.2247191011235956,0.054783464986671616,548,The posted speed limit sign is in miles per hour not miles per second. Either way it's melted now.
2074,1,18,70,89,1.2247191011235956,0.047277269286691515,548,So how do I explain my melted radar gun to the chief?

2074,4,12,73,89,1.2247191011235956,0.054783464986671616,548,I don't suppose you know why I pulled you over...
2074,5,10,74,89,1.2247191011235956,0.05706654581152649,548,They told me I could pick any car in the lot.
2074,6,8,75,89,1.2247191011235956,0.05926173525785613,548,I'll do you a favor and write you up for only doing 150 in a 35 mph zone
2074,2,16,71,89,1.2247191011235956,0.04990493769277266,548,I must not have been going that fast. You caught me.
2074,2,16,71,89,1.2247191011235956,0.04990493769277266,548,"License and immigration, please."

2552,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,548,This is an illegal landing zone; I am going to have to ask you to move.
2552,5,7,73,85,1.2,0.05749193098906611,548,Because I have acrophobia.
2552,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,548,So sir I caught you for texting and flying...
2552,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,548,"Airplane seat belts don't pass muster down here, pal."
2552,5,7,73,85,1.2,0.05749193098906611,548,Your parachute failed to deploy at the last stop sign.
2552,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,548,"I don't need to be a rocket science to give you a ticket, Mister."
2552,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,548,"Sir, no need to speed yet. The Canadian border's open till January 20th."
2552,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,548,So this is the new Tesla!
2552,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,548,You were traveling at Mach 2 in a 45 mile per hour zone.
2552,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,548,"Sir, do you know how fast you were fleeing the country?"
2552,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,548,I'm writing you up for a noise violation when you broke the sound barrier.
2552,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,548,"Sorry, but the Salt Lake flats are in Utah."
2552,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,548,Is it because I'm white?
2552,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,548,I clocked you at 850.
2552,5,7,73,85,1.2,0.05749193098906611,548,"I don't know, couldn't have been more than eight hundred."
2552,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,548,"If you were going any slower, I'd have to be writing you a parking ticket."
2552,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,548,"So you're going to Canada, are you? Can I hitch a ride?"
2552,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,548,NASA is really aiming low these days.
2552,1,15,69,85,1.2,0.04674263524428026,548,I've clocked you going 20x the speed of sound in a 10x the speed of sound zone.
2552,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,548,"You were doing 25,000 mph in a 25 mph zone...."
2552,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,548,You missed 74 stop signs and destroyed a cow. Selfie?
2552,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,548,"Mr. Musk, you're no longer in California."
2552,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,548,Hmmm...do I know how fast I was going...55? 75? 285? Let me know when I'm getting warm...

2552,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,548,"That's right, Mr. Musk. You're required to have both a front and a rear license plate."
2552,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,548,How's the pick up?
2552,5,7,73,85,1.2,0.05749193098906611,548,"I don't care if you were faster than sound, using a phone while driving is illegal."
2552,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,548,You were doing 38 in a 30 mph zone.
2552,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,548,I didn't see anything... I heard a sonic boom.
2552,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,548,"Do you know why I pulled you over, Sir?"
2552,0,17,68,85,1.2,0.04364357804719847,548,Do you know what mach you were going?
2552,5,7,73,85,1.2,0.05749193098906611,548,"For safety, I'll need you to push this off the highway until your tow arrives."
2552,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,548,Are you sure the sign didn't say ONE sixty-five officer?
2552,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,548,I had you doing Mach 4 in a 30 mile per hour zone.
2552,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,548,"Yes, I do know how to get to the Bonneville Salt Flats but you were still speeding."
2552,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,548,You've got a broken tail light.
2552,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,548,You were clocked at Mach 4 in a Mach 3 Zone.
2552,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,548,Wrong turn Mr. Musk?
2552,5,7,73,85,1.2,0.05749193098906611,548,"No, I don't issue warnings to first-time rocket offenders."
2552,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,548,Sir did you know your taillight was out?
2552,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,548,"""You're kidding! This is a no fly zone?"
2552,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,548,Did you realize that you were doing Mach 7 in a school zone?
2552,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,548,"Sorry for the inconvenience Senator McConnell, and give your best to the Mrs."
2552,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,548,Can I see your smog certificate?
2552,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,548,I'm going to have to write you up on that missing tail light.
2552,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,548,Could you tell me how fast you were going?

2552,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,548,"Sir, are you aware your license plate light is out?"
2552,5,7,73,85,1.2,0.05749193098906611,548,I clocked you at 500 times the speed limit.
2552,1,15,69,85,1.2,0.04674263524428026,548,I'll take a driver's license or a pilot's license.
2552,1,15,69,85,1.2,0.04674263524428026,548,Don't give me that old perception and reality stuff.
2552,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,548,Your afterburners need watering.
2552,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,548,Your tail lights are out.
2552,5,7,73,85,1.2,0.05749193098906611,548,"Hey rocket man. You might rule the skyway, but the highway is still my way."
2552,5,7,73,85,1.2,0.05749193098906611,548,"Oh, so you heard the results of the election?"
2552,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,548,"Thanks for pulling over. I see you are not wearing a  seat belt, and your catalytic converter seems to be defective."
2552,5,7,73,85,1.2,0.05749193098906611,548,I stopped you for tailgating
2552,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,548,Could you tell me which way to the moon?
2552,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,548,You failed to signal before you turned and burned
2552,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,548,I pulled you over because your taillights are burned out.
2552,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,548,You were doing Mach 1 in a twenty-five.
2552,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,548,Show me your pilot's license and registration.

2552,0,17,68,85,1.2,0.04364357804719847,548,"Officer, forget it. The judge won,'t believe you."
2552,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,548,"Your right rear breaklight is out, plus, this is the most extreme mid-life crisis car I have seen."
2552,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,548,Do you realize you were going 200mph over the speed limit?
2552,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,548,Fire or a weddin'?
2552,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,548,You were going Mach 3 in a Mach 1.
2552,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,548,"Here's a ticket for $1,000,006, you were going a thousand miles an hour above the speed limit. Slow down."
2552,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,548,"""What makes you think I was speeding""."
2552,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,548,"Sir, are you licensed by anyone else besides Donald Trump?"
2552,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,548,All of our squad cars are now outfitted with warp drive.
2552,0,17,68,85,1.2,0.04364357804719847,548,"Sorry officer, I hit the wrong star-date."
2552,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,548,"Those aren't street legal after-burners, are they son?"
2552,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,548,"Your tail-lights are not only burned out, they burned down several head of cattle and a few goats."
2552,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,548,You incinerated that bicyclist you passed.
2552,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,548,I've heard that one before.
2552,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,548,"Do you know why I stopped you today, ma'am?"
2552,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,548,"Is there something wrong, officer?"
2552,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,548,"Okay, where's the supernova?"
2552,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,548,"Really, that fast?"
2552,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,548,"Sir in some places passing to the left isn't even legal, let alone passing over them."
2552,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,548,you're going mach 3 in a mach 2 zone.
2552,5,7,73,85,1.2,0.05749193098906611,548,Sorry 'Sully' but I'm going to need full name and registration.
2552,5,7,73,85,1.2,0.05749193098906611,548,"Yes, Officer, I understand - no more Ludicrous Mode here in Mayberry"
2552,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,548,"Officer, I was just keeping up with traffic!"
2552,6,5,74,85,1.2,0.05987849508520957,548,"You say you were only going 17,600 MPH ?"
2552,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,548,You'll need to take a defensive driver class.
2552,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,548,"Don't give me that old ""Which way to the Bonneville Salt Flats?"" line. I hear it every day."
2552,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,548,"It starts 95% of the time, do you think I should call AAA?"
2552,7,3,75,85,1.2,0.06217351701880306,548,The box said after four hours see a doctor immediately.
2552,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,548,What's your hurry?
2552,1,15,69,85,1.2,0.04674263524428026,548,Did you know that your left solid rocket engine light is out?
2552,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,548,You were clocked going over 400 mph in a 55 zone but I'm letting you off with a warning this time.
2552,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,548,"I'm sorry Sir, but spear nose attachments are illegal in this state."
2552,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,548,"No arguments sir, your left and right rocket launchers need replacing."
2552,1,15,69,85,1.2,0.04674263524428026,548,You made an illegal turn at the Skyway exit.
2552,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,548,The fine for Mach 1 is going to be a little stiff.
2552,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,548,"Just signal before you merge next time, okay?"
2552,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,548,"Sir, your left tail light is out."
2552,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,548,"I don't know what you're used to in the city, but there's a $50 fine for sonic booms in these here parts."

2552,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,548,"Barron, not again! What's your father gonna say this time?"
2552,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,548,Sorry to stop you sir but your tail light is out.
2552,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,548,Did you know you were going warp 2 in a school zone?
2552,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,548,I realize that Mr. Musk but I will have to give you a ticket.
2552,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,548,It's a hybrid from Tesla and SpaceX
2552,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,548,Please step out of the rocket. Your registration sticker appears to have expired last month.

2552,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,548,Have you by chance seen 2 thugs in hoodies? We've had some complaints.
2552,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,548,"Mr. Musk, did you realize your tail light was out?"
2552,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,548,"If you're not allowed to exceed the speed of light, it's for a reason."

2672,3,11,72,86,1.197674418604651,0.051833067425708014,548,But when I bought it seat belts were optional.

2684,1,14,68,83,1.1927710843373494,0.04681395181381146,548,Texting while operating a vehicle is illegal in this state.
2684,2,12,69,83,1.1927710843373494,0.04985383079259017,548,I'm curious - is this the new hybrid model?

2684,3,10,70,83,1.1927710843373494,0.05271871399196457,548,But the final frontier has no speed limit!
2684,2,12,69,83,1.1927710843373494,0.04985383079259017,548,I clocked you a light speed in a warp speed zone.
2684,3,10,70,83,1.1927710843373494,0.05271871399196457,548,I don't care what the speed limit is on Mars -- here it's 55 mph!

2684,2,12,69,83,1.1927710843373494,0.04985383079259017,548,"Sir, do you realize you were going at the speed of light in a 30 mile per hour zone?"
2684,3,10,70,83,1.1927710843373494,0.05271871399196457,548,"Before my radar gun exploded, it clocked you doing 500 in a 35 mile an hour zone."
2684,1,14,68,83,1.1927710843373494,0.04681395181381146,548,We don't see many plates from up there.

2684,2,12,69,83,1.1927710843373494,0.04985383079259017,548,"Klingon schmingon, entering warp drive without a seat belt gets you a ticket in these parts."
2684,3,10,70,83,1.1927710843373494,0.05271871399196457,548,"Sir Richard, I'm afraid that you were 1,401 mph over the speed limit."
2684,4,8,71,83,1.1927710843373494,0.05543573906097862,548,You gave yourself away by breaking the sound barrier.
2684,2,12,69,83,1.1927710843373494,0.04985383079259017,548,"Sorry to have to do this, son, but that sound barrier was county property."
2684,4,8,71,83,1.1927710843373494,0.05543573906097862,548,This is just a warning. Next time make sure to turn off your blinker.
2684,2,12,69,83,1.1927710843373494,0.04985383079259017,548,It's your front bumper--not pedestrian-friendly.
2684,3,10,70,83,1.1927710843373494,0.05271871399196457,548,"That's right, Officer. My name is Nose Cohen."
2684,1,14,68,83,1.1927710843373494,0.04681395181381146,548,"And, for breaking the sound barrier, the fine is double."

3039,4,6,70,80,1.175,0.05561793263309727,548,Your diarrhea required you to go Mach 3?
3039,2,10,68,80,1.175,0.04960285312333035,548,"I don't care what your GPS is telling you, this is not the way to the International Space Station."
3039,1,12,67,80,1.175,0.04630321092291712,548,"Sorry officer, but left my license in my other flight suit."
3039,4,6,70,80,1.175,0.05561793263309727,548,Every part built in the U.S.A...except the GPS.
3039,4,6,70,80,1.175,0.05561793263309727,548,May I see your pilots license and registration. I also hate the song Rocket Man.
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,"Proof of insurance? You're kidding me, right?"
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,I can't move it. Somebody planted bean vines in the afterburners.
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,I clocked you at 475 in a 30 zone.
3039,2,10,68,80,1.175,0.04960285312333035,548,. . . and my radar gun fried!
3039,4,6,70,80,1.175,0.05561793263309727,548,"Get it right and all you get is a warning, ""why do you think I stopped you""?"
3039,1,12,67,80,1.175,0.04630321092291712,548,"Tyler, its your left tail light....again."
3039,4,6,70,80,1.175,0.05561793263309727,548,"They said I could test out the toupee before buying it, officer."
3039,2,10,68,80,1.175,0.04960285312333035,548,"No. sir, the new administration has not privatized state highways, yet."
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,You were going 500 in a 30 mile an hour zone.
3039,2,10,68,80,1.175,0.04960285312333035,548,"Back from the future, huh? Well when you see ""Doc"", tell him to put a governor on the flux capacitor."
3039,4,6,70,80,1.175,0.05561793263309727,548,Looks like you've got a tail light burned out.
3039,1,12,67,80,1.175,0.04630321092291712,548,I'm gonna ticket you for driving with a broken tail light.
3039,1,12,67,80,1.175,0.04630321092291712,548,"But from 30,000 feet it looked like a runway"
3039,1,12,67,80,1.175,0.04630321092291712,548,"Know how fast you were going, Mr. McFly?"
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,"I'm sorry officer, but this thing won't go below 300 miles per hour."
3039,2,10,68,80,1.175,0.04960285312333035,548,Speeding?
3039,1,12,67,80,1.175,0.04630321092291712,548,"Sir, I am going to have to issue you a ticket. That right brake light is not working."
3039,2,10,68,80,1.175,0.04960285312333035,548,"By the way, how many miles per gallon on this thing?"
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,"Not speeding, I'm ticketing you for driving unreasonably."
3039,1,12,67,80,1.175,0.04630321092291712,548,Do you know you have a brake light out?
3039,5,4,71,80,1.175,0.058393579497940336,548,"Is that a 'rocket in your pocket', or you just happy to see me?"
3039,1,12,67,80,1.175,0.04630321092291712,548,"Sorry to write you up, but you were really ""burning up the road"" back there."
3039,2,10,68,80,1.175,0.04960285312333035,548,The only problem is your taillight is out.
3039,2,10,68,80,1.175,0.04960285312333035,548,"OK, I need for you to be honest with me, sir. Were you using your cell phone either immediately before, or during your landing?"
3039,2,10,68,80,1.175,0.04960285312333035,548,"I'm sorry, but the limit is Mach 3 in school zones."
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,And don't tell me your speedometer hasn't been working.
3039,4,6,70,80,1.175,0.05561793263309727,548,"Your registration sir.You were clocked at Mach 1, 700 mph above the posted limit."
3039,1,12,67,80,1.175,0.04630321092291712,548,I'm gonna need to take a look in the cargo bay.
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,Your tail lights aren't working sir.
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,"Officer, the sign did say 395."
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,"You might be used to going that fast on Mars, but now you're in my County!"
3039,5,4,71,80,1.175,0.058393579497940336,548,You've got to be the least endowed person I've ever pulled over.
3039,4,6,70,80,1.175,0.05561793263309727,548,I don't care that your wife sent you out for milk.
3039,1,12,67,80,1.175,0.04630321092291712,548,"Fact is, sir, there is no smoking on any thoroughfare statewide."
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,Are you aware that you didn't signal before you moved to warp speed?
3039,0,14,66,80,1.175,0.0427496391279461,548,You were doing Mach 4 in a 55 zone.
3039,1,12,67,80,1.175,0.04630321092291712,548,"""I don't recognize this import, but your taillight is out."
3039,2,10,68,80,1.175,0.04960285312333035,548,"Gee officer, I'm really just taking up space."
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,"So... you don't want to live on this planet anymore... I'll make a note of it. However, while you're still here, I will need to see your license and registration. I'm sure you understand."
3039,1,12,67,80,1.175,0.04630321092291712,548,"Officer, I swear, this thing NEVER got airborne."
3039,1,12,67,80,1.175,0.04630321092291712,548,Are you aware you were going Mach .65 in a Mach .40 zone?
3039,1,12,67,80,1.175,0.04630321092291712,548,"Your driver's license expires 20 years from now, Mr. McFly"
3039,2,10,68,80,1.175,0.04960285312333035,548,"And you have to get this rocket back to Cape Canaveral fast, Is that what I'm supposed to believe?"
3039,2,10,68,80,1.175,0.04960285312333035,548,"I would've let you off with a warning, but your failure to have a proof of insurance card is something I just can't ignore."
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,When's the last time you had a smog check?
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,"I'm gonna let you off this time, but you've got to replace that front bumper."
3039,1,12,67,80,1.175,0.04630321092291712,548,You blew right through that last sound barrier.
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,"Son, where on Earth did this pass emissions...L.A. or China?"
3039,2,10,68,80,1.175,0.04960285312333035,548,Do you know why I asked you to pull over?
3039,4,6,70,80,1.175,0.05561793263309727,548,Not for speed. For contaminating the GMO crops.
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,"Sir, I'm going to have to bring you in to the space station."
3039,4,6,70,80,1.175,0.05561793263309727,548,"Your license doesn't show a rocket endorsement, but your ""Mars or Bust"" tee shirt tickles me. I'll let you off with a warning."
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,"Yeah right, and your Elon Musk."
3039,2,10,68,80,1.175,0.04960285312333035,548,It appears you have an unpaid parking ticket.
3039,2,10,68,80,1.175,0.04960285312333035,548,"Well, you're being cited for an illegal bumper, failure to wear a helmet, and going Mach 2 through a construction zone."
3039,2,10,68,80,1.175,0.04960285312333035,548,Illegal muffler.
3039,4,6,70,80,1.175,0.05561793263309727,548,Things looked different when Tesla bought SpaceX
3039,2,10,68,80,1.175,0.04960285312333035,548,"'I think it's going to be a long, long time...before you get your licence back.'"
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,I clocked you at about a light-year in a 55.
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,"Why yes, I am a New York Jets fan. How did you know officer?"
3039,4,6,70,80,1.175,0.05561793263309727,548,"But in my frame of reference, officer, I wasn't speeding at all."
3039,2,10,68,80,1.175,0.04960285312333035,548,"This is your last warning, Mr. Sullenberger."
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,"I'm gonna let you off with a warning. But if you don't fix that taillight, next time's a ticket."
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,"I clocked you at only 45 miles per hour, What's the matter with you?"
3039,1,12,67,80,1.175,0.04630321092291712,548,You don't see them steering wheel knobs much anymore.
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,"You're tail light is incinerated. Get it fixed. Next time, I'll have to give you a ticket."
3039,2,10,68,80,1.175,0.04960285312333035,548,In town for the Inventors Convention?
3039,2,10,68,80,1.175,0.04960285312333035,548,Thanks to you I'll exceed my monthly ticket quota.
3039,2,10,68,80,1.175,0.04960285312333035,548,Break the law? Yes. But you also broke the sound barrier.
3039,4,6,70,80,1.175,0.05561793263309727,548,In this county we strictly enforce the light speed limit.
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,Vehicles of this size are supposed to have mud flaps.
3039,2,10,68,80,1.175,0.04960285312333035,548,Do you know you have a tail light out?
3039,4,6,70,80,1.175,0.05561793263309727,548,"Mr. Jetson, do you have a license for this century?"
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,You were only doing 30 in a 45 MPH zone.
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,"Sorry, thought you were the other kind of alien"
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,"Speeding is an abstract concept, don't you think?"
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,Do you realize that your brake lights need replacement?
3039,2,10,68,80,1.175,0.04960285312333035,548,Do you have any idea how fast you were Boeing?
3039,5,4,71,80,1.175,0.058393579497940336,548,I believe you have an aardvark in your tailpipe.
3039,1,12,67,80,1.175,0.04630321092291712,548,This is not the autobahn
3039,1,12,67,80,1.175,0.04630321092291712,548,"Actually, you're still hurtling through space at about 67,000 miles per hour."
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,What's all the rush?
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,"Your speed was fine, but I'm going to have to ticket you for overcompensating."
3039,0,14,66,80,1.175,0.0427496391279461,548,"You see, Officer, it doesn't matter if the lights are on when you're going this fast."
3039,1,12,67,80,1.175,0.04630321092291712,548,The State of Iowa doesn't care if it is a hybrid.
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,Are you aware one of your tail-lights is out?
3039,1,12,67,80,1.175,0.04630321092291712,548,"Yep, BOTH taillights!"
3039,4,6,70,80,1.175,0.05561793263309727,548,You are probably wondering why I pulled you over......your left tail light is out.
3039,2,10,68,80,1.175,0.04960285312333035,548,Your catalytic converter is busted.
3039,5,4,71,80,1.175,0.058393579497940336,548,Sorry. Trump's jealous.
3039,4,6,70,80,1.175,0.05561793263309727,548,"Thanks for pulling over, it gets lonely out here."
3039,2,10,68,80,1.175,0.04960285312333035,548,Did you know you have a broken tail light?
3039,1,12,67,80,1.175,0.04630321092291712,548,I wasn't speeding officer. This thing can go a lot faster.
3039,1,12,67,80,1.175,0.04630321092291712,548,"You were doing Mach 4 on a Mach 1 road, that’s what!"
3039,1,12,67,80,1.175,0.04630321092291712,548,No matter what galaxy your from you still need a current license plate.
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,We're you aware that one of your tail lights is out?
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,It's not Rocket Science Sir. If you wish to contest the fine follow the instructions on the back of the summons.
3039,2,10,68,80,1.175,0.04960285312333035,548,"""THE PROBLEM""?.......""You were going mach2 in a 55mph zone""!"
3039,1,12,67,80,1.175,0.04630321092291712,548,Einstein was wrong. Space/time does not apply to I66.
3039,2,10,68,80,1.175,0.04960285312333035,548,I can't step out! There's no door!
3039,1,12,67,80,1.175,0.04630321092291712,548,"Sir, the speed limit on this road is 35 mph, not the speed of sound."
3039,4,6,70,80,1.175,0.05561793263309727,548,"Do you know why I pulled you over?"" ""To play guessing games?"
3039,1,12,67,80,1.175,0.04630321092291712,548,I didn't see the speed limit upon reentry.
3039,2,10,68,80,1.175,0.04960285312333035,548,"Sir, you're in the HOV lane."
3039,2,10,68,80,1.175,0.04960285312333035,548,Do you know why I'm pulling you over?
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,I'm afraid the Trump Administration's new fuel efficiency standards haven't gone into effect yet sir.
3039,2,10,68,80,1.175,0.04960285312333035,548,Are you aware your left rear backup thruster indicator light is burnt out.
3039,0,14,66,80,1.175,0.0427496391279461,548,Pilot's license and registered flight plan please.
3039,1,12,67,80,1.175,0.04630321092291712,548,"Sir, do you know why I pulled you over?"
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,Looks like your left tail light is out.
3039,2,10,68,80,1.175,0.04960285312333035,548,Why? Your seat belt wasn't fastened.
3039,2,10,68,80,1.175,0.04960285312333035,548,"But officer, I wasn't even out of first gear!"
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,"I'm gonna let you go with a warning this time, but don't let me catch you driving at the speed of sound again."
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,Your taillight is burned out.
3039,3,8,69,80,1.175,0.05269628766978955,548,"I'm sorry, officer. I just REALLY needed to get to a restroom."
3039,1,12,67,80,1.175,0.04630321092291712,548,"Buddy, everyone thinks they're an urban legend."
3039,0,14,66,80,1.175,0.0427496391279461,548,No. I don't know where the fire is.
3039,4,6,70,80,1.175,0.05561793263309727,548,I stopped you because your left tail light is out.
3039,1,12,67,80,1.175,0.04630321092291712,548,I'm going to have to write you up for driving without headlights and rear view mirrors.

4075,0,10,66,76,1.131578947368421,0.03903262361629298,548,You wonder why I stopped you? It's your left rear parking light.
4080,2,6,69,77,1.12987012987013,0.04658776821420219,548,"I understand it was out of this world, it's still considered reckless driving."
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,But officer I thought it was a mach per hour
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,Your tail lights have burned out.
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,So I get a ticket even though I just broke the world land speed record.
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,It's the new Presidential Limousine. He does not pay tickets.
4081,4,1,67,72,1.125,0.05572645856918899,548,The only way you aren't getting a speeding ticket is if you take me to the moon and back home before sunset.
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,did you know you were doing 35 in a 25 m.p.h. zone?
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"Sir, do you know how fast you were going?"
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,Do you know you were breaking the speed record back there?
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"Given that I caught up with you, you might want to submit this ticket I'm writing along with a refund request for your poky rocket."
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,Here's a ticket for climate changing lanes.
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,It's a ticket for not taking me with you.
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,Superman just came out of nowhere!
4081,3,3,66,72,1.125,0.05209800262902861,548,"Did you know you had a taillight out? I see... Well, did you know that taillight was one word?"
4081,3,3,66,72,1.125,0.05209800262902861,548,I pulled you over because your break lights aren't working.
4081,3,3,66,72,1.125,0.05209800262902861,548,"Well, you must have been speeding too."
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,Highway 265?? Oh I thought...
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,Warp drive comes standard in all the new police cruisers!
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,Sir one of your booster rockets is out. Please step out of the vehicle.
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,I won't be able to pay the fine. I'm on a one way trip to Mars.
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,Your after-burners took out two joggers....
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,I'm going to have to write you a ticket for broken tail lights.
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,I don't care if you are lost; this is not a flyover!
4081,3,3,66,72,1.125,0.05209800262902861,548,"Barron, not again! What's your father gonna say this time?"
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,You exceeded the speed of sound.
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,- Where are you going sir? - To Canada.
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"Did you see that sign back there that said ""No sonic booms""?"
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,"What do you think this is, the Autobahn?"
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,No. There are no fill up hydrogen peroxide stations near here.
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,License and registration. I don't care that she lost the election and you want to get out of the country. You still have to stay within the speed limit
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"jest curious, what kind a mileage ya get"
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"Sorry, I wasn't briefed on the seatbelt laws of this era."
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,You're pointed in the wrong direction.
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,You almost hit a drone back there.
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,"I don't care what the limit is on planet Nimsovi, you're speeding HERE."
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,You didn't signal before you went straight up back there.
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"Officer, please don't bust up my mid-life dream."
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,I'm gonna have to write you up for creating a sonic boom in a work zone and a tail light out.
4081,3,3,66,72,1.125,0.05209800262902861,548,What do you think this is boy?! The Bonnyville Salt Flats?
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,Never mind how fast I had to be going in order to catch you!
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,Do you know why I stopped you for the seventeenth time today?
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,It isn't rocket science. Mach 2 will cost you $50.
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,How many demerit points? Let's just say your great-grandchildren will probably still be working this one off for you.
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,You failed to signal when you turned left at Jupiter.
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"What do you mean... ""Show me your smog check certificate"" ?"
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,Sorry. This is not the Bonneville salt flats.
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,"Given these times, you're not the first."
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,Do you have any idea how fast you were texting?
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"Don't give me that, Cher told me the same thing last week."
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,How do you spell 'mach'?
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,D.U.I.F.O.
4081,3,3,66,72,1.125,0.05209800262902861,548,"Sorry officer, could't see you there."
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,Going faster than the speed of light is still no excuse for missing that stop sign.
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"I'm sorry if I was going too fast, but the speedometer only works in Mach numbers."
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,It's a shoulder harness not a seat belt and I'm sitting on a parachute not a seat.
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,"You familiar with the phrase: click it or ticket, Sir?"
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,"It's the new Tesla, under a Police Interceptor body."
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,You didn’t break our speed limit — you broke our glitz limit.
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,"Can we speed this up, I am in a hurry."
4081,3,3,66,72,1.125,0.05209800262902861,548,""" license, registration please.... oh by the way, what is the make of your vehicle? Saturn?"
4081,3,3,66,72,1.125,0.05209800262902861,548,"Sir, do you know how fast you were going?"" ""Faster than the current action on climate change."
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,I clocked you ten over hyperspeed.
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,Your brake lights are smoked!
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,"You were doing 65,000 in a 55,000 zone."
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,Your left thruster signal seems to be on the fritz.
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"I'll let you off with a warning this time, but your tail-light is out."
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,Your right rear tail light is out.
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,You failed to signal when you turned 90 degrees starboard back there.
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"You sure know how to get a ticket, eh?"
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"It's not the speed, nor the noise, it's the flowers from the tail pipes we object to."
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"I'm sorry officer, the throttle on this is just really sensitive."
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,I may have to test drive it to see how fast you were going.
4081,3,3,66,72,1.125,0.05209800262902861,548,"What's your hurry, Mister?"
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,"Sir, I pulled you over because both of your tail engines were out"
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"""Did you know your Dilithium Crystal turn signal is out on the right?"
4081,3,3,66,72,1.125,0.05209800262902861,548,"Sir, are you aware the driving limit isn't light speed?"
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"Why did I stop you? Haven't a clue? Well mister smarty pants, your plates are expired."
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,It runs on solar power
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"Because you were approaching the speed of light, you get the AARP discount."
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"Sir, how slow do you think you weren't going?"
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,I'm stopping you because you clipped a Harrier back there.
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"I recognize that it's an idiom, sir, but I meant it quite literally."
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"Officer, when I'm going that fast, I'm not looking at the speedometer."
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,"You were doing 1,250 in a thirty-five."
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,There are a couple of things that keep the Blue Flame from being street legal.
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,Sorry pal. Click it or ticket.
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,Do you realize you were doing 250 in a 200 mph zone?
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"Sir, you have a broken tail light."
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,Let me guess - you're late for work on Mars.
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"I see that your name is Elton John, but you still have no right to drive that vehicle as fast as a rocket, man!"
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"Setting aside the speeding violation, your stop and turn lights appear to have burnt out."
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,"just step out of the -er, rocket, please sir"
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"Oh, you're a populist candidate for president... Apologies - carry on..."
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"Not as fast as thought, catcha"
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,I experienced a malfunction and luckily found this nice stretch of road. I´d appreciate an escort to the closest air base.
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"....AND, ACCORDING TO YOUR LICENSE, YOUR NAME IS GEORGE...GEORGE JETSON..."
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,I'll let you off with a warning
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,Do you mind stepping out of your rocket?
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"No sir, a light-year is a unit of distance, not time. Plus, the signs indicate miles per hour!"
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,Looks like you might have been speeding today.
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,"Your mom needs you to pick up milk, eggs and a loaf of bread on your way home. And make it snappy."
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"And no, it's not about the rocket."
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,Do you know why I pulled you over today?
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"Officer, I have already have a ticket for the broken tail light...."
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"License, registration and interplanetary insurance card please"
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,No license plate.
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,They told me this was okay in Utah!
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"You were doing 2,275 mph in a 55 mph speed zone."
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,Didja know you were going 231 miles an hour?
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,You were going mach 5 in a 25.
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"Sir, you were driving at speeds out of this world."
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"When you sped by the donut shop, you soured the cream filling."
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"You know transporting an illegal alien is a felony, right?"
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,no Sir it is not for the red light its for the 14 full stop signs you missed
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,Going over the speed of sound is no excuse for not hearing my siren
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"No, there's nothing wrong. Just a broken tail light."
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"No, it's not your speed, it's your pollution!!"
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,You really should use the GPS.
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,"How did you tail me, officer?"
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,Your right booster is out
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"I'm sorry, officer, I left my registration on Mars."
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,"Sir, did you know that one of your tail lights is out?"
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,Do you even have brake lights?
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,Did you realize you were doing 700 mph over the speed limit?
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"Officer, the abstraction/s verisimilar"
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"Yes, quite an improvement on Air Force One, Mr. Trump."
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,"Are you aware of your trajectory, sir?"
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,This is a first. 25 years on the force and you're the first Elon I've ever ticketed
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"I wasn't speeding officer, honest."
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,You were going 800m.p.h. in a 40m.p.h. zone.
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,Your seatbelt wasn't on when you broke the sound barrier.
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"Mister, you can't be serious about just looking for a place to park."
4081,3,3,66,72,1.125,0.05209800262902861,548,Registration?
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,Your tail lights are too bright.
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,I don't want to hear your excuses for why you were going faster than the speed of sound.
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"'Your getting a ticket because you ran a stop sign-500 miles ago"""
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,"Yes, officer I can think of a few reasons why you pulled me over."
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,Our department wants to expand beyond military surplus.
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"I clocked you at 1,395 over the limit. Doesn't happen very often. Not even out here"
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"Sir, ... are you aware that you were going Mach 1 in a twenty-five miles an hour zone school safety zone?"
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"Playing a little loose with the Speed limit there, sir."
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"No, there is no Sonic drive through here"
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,Let me guess. You were born about 1966.
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"UFO or not, electric or hybrid makes no difference, you were still going too fast!"
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,"I don't care if you are Evel Knievel reincarnated ,160 is too FAST"
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,"If you're an African American between the ages of 18 and 34, please step out of your jet car."
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,"SIR,MAY I SEE YOUR ASTRONAUT'S LICENSE"
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,Improper plane change.
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"Well, I've been following you for about 800 miles."
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"You were passing in a no passing zone, sir."
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,"Ever heard of altitude limits, son!"
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,I wasn't profiling you as a speeder.
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,I clocked you at over Mach 1 Chuck.
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,Can you just let me off with a warning? I was just on the way to replacing the left-turn signal light..
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"Wait, this isn't Mars?"
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,Do you know that you're driving with expired NASA plates?
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"Sir, did you know your left tail light is out?"
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,Did you know you were going 600 in a 20 mile an hour speed zone?
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"Officer, if you had such a fine automobile, would you drive it slow?"
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,And how many light years per hour did you say you were going? Please step out for a sobriety test.
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"Sir, your left afterburner is burnt out."
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,I stopped you for doing Mach 4 in Mach i zone.
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"She may be a sedan, but she really kicks in at 10,000 miles per hour."
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,We find ourselves in an unusual situation.
4081,3,3,66,72,1.125,0.05209800262902861,548,"Sir, you can't outrun lousy mileage."
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,License and excuse summation
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"Sir, do you have any idea how many light-years per hour you were going?"
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,It's also against the law to exceed traffic light speed.
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,You were doing 439 in a 65 zone.
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"So you missed the sign, 'THREE-WHEELERS NOT ALLOWED '?"
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,...And your greenhouse gas emissions have exceeded the local 55 ton/day limit.
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,The gas mileage is actually better than you would think.
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,I hope YOU know how fast you were going - 'cuz I sure don't.
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,Just keep it below Mach 0.07 next time and we'll leave you alone.
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,"No, I said driver's license, not pilot's license."
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"Yes, children were present."
4081,3,3,66,72,1.125,0.05209800262902861,548,Mach 3 is definately over the speed limit.
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,There's a feminist march up ahead. If you want to live I'd suggest going another way.
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,I'm sorry but I have to give you a ticket because one of your turn signals is out.
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"Officer, as you can see I'm in a rush. Could you please make this quick."
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,Where's the retrofire?
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"I clocked you at ""Mach 1""!"
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,"No, it isn't Kansas, but we still call it home!"
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,I don't care about interplanetary speed limits.
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"I'm sorry Elon, but you were going 5 times the speed of sound over the limit."
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,What’s your problem? Do you think that staying within the speed limit is rocket science?
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,Your tailights are not working
4081,3,3,66,72,1.125,0.05209800262902861,548,"Mr. President, please step out of the conflict of interest."
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,Hughes? How is that spelled?
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,Where's the fire?
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"You were doing Mach 0.15 in a Mach 0.05 zone, and by the way, where's the fire?"
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,I noticed you have a non working license plate light sir !
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"So, how do you plead to the charge of speeding?"
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,So it's a parking ticket instead of acclaim for making it back from Mars?
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"The good news, you broke the land speed record."
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,"Sir, were you driving high?"
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,Twenty thousand miles over the speed limit gives you an astronomical fine.
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,You were clocked doing Tom Hanks in an Eddie Albert zone.
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,Your left tail light is out. I'm going to have to write you a ticket.
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"Well, sir, you were doing the speed of sound in a thirty-five mile per hour zone."
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,I stopped you because you have a broken tail light
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"Please, book me on the drugs fixing the tail light will cost a fortune."
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,Sir you forgot to signal at the last sound barrier
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"- Officer, was I driving too fast? - No, you were flying too low..."
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"Sir, i don't know if you are aware of this?, but your taillights are in flames."
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"Doesn't matter. When you hit the highway, the limit is 75 miles an hour."
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"Your tail lights are out, there is no inspection sticker and you can't drive for crap."
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,You can't bring that into the country.
4081,3,3,66,72,1.125,0.05209800262902861,548,"I'm going to give you a warning on the speeding, but I cannot overlook the noise pollution violation by breaking the sound barrier."
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,Your backlight needs to be changed.
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,Actually you were going 700 mph over the limit!
4081,3,3,66,72,1.125,0.05209800262902861,548,You were passing on the double yellow line.
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,Two out of three?
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"You were doing 17,200 in a 55 zone!"
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,Do you know how many decibels you were going?
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"Rocket License and Registration, please."
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,"Sorry, officer... I had no idea my tail-light was out."
4081,3,3,66,72,1.125,0.05209800262902861,548,I think it's gonna be a long long time til you get this license back.
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"Anything you say can and will be used against you, assuming the sound waves reach me."
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"Air and noise pollution, Obama is still our president."
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,Scoot over and let me take her for a spin.
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,"Sir, you were doing the speed of light in a 55."
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,You should have seen the size of the bottle
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,I suppose you were not aware there is a weight restriction on this road!
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"I'll be honest, the speedometer melted off."
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"You know, I pulled you over to inform you that the Darwin Awards were already selected last week."
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,In a rush to get over the border before the wall is built?
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"""I've never seen a drivers license from Pluto before""."
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"Officer, there's no way i was going above the speed limit."
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,Do you know what the fine is for 500 M.P.H over the speed limit?
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,You were clocked at eight hundred in a no afterburner zone.
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"Still trying to beat that Toyota Corona, huh?"
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,Depends. How long have you been following me?
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,Do you know the land speed record round these parts?
4081,3,3,66,72,1.125,0.05209800262902861,548,"Nice try, cowboy, but this thing jest AIN'T one-o'-them gigant-o barbecues, now, is it?"
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,"You know you were going 632,550 in a 632,525?"
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,Your break-the-sound-barrier lights are out.
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,I thought I told you to lay low.
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"Sorry, sonny, you can't drive your dad's private jet with only a learner's permit."
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"Officer, The after burners don't even kick in until I reach 220 MPH."
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,Speeding?! My speedometer said I was only going 35!
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,You shouldn't have relied on federal funding.
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,"Yaw didn't think we'd catcha after hitt'n that there satellite, didja?!"
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,You broke the speed barrier
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,A rocket scientist such as yourself should know you can't drive through here at the speed of sound.
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,You sucked up two deer back there!
4081,0,9,63,72,1.125,0.039249114101422455,548,I clocked you at mach 1 in a 55.
4081,1,7,64,72,1.125,0.043951442120546434,548,"Spacio-temporal disruption or not, I'll still need to see your license and registration."
4081,2,5,65,72,1.125,0.048197153144195225,548,There is no such thing as a license plate exemption.

5105,0,5,63,68,1.0735294117647058,0.03188665499421398,548,Did you realize you were going seventeen thousand miles an hour above the speed limit?

5114,0,5,64,69,1.0724637681159421,0.03143919678531251,548,Did you know you were driving 600 miles per hour through a fly-over county?
5114,0,5,64,69,1.0724637681159421,0.03143919678531251,548,Is it Too much? You can tell me.
5114,0,5,64,69,1.0724637681159421,0.03143919678531251,548,I clocked you at 43.3 mph in a 50 mph zone. I think your jets need a tuneup.
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,"But officer, I was told it was owned by a school teacher who never went over 35 miles an hour."
5118,1,2,61,64,1.0625,0.03776362363229024,548,"Sorry Officer, my mom obviously lied about that whole size doesn't matter thing."
5118,1,2,61,64,1.0625,0.03776362363229024,548,"Doing 150 in a 40 mile an hour zone is one thing,having your hand on this siren is quite another."
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,But I thought the speed limit was Mach 3.
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,"I believe your right tail light is out, and you rolled through that last stop sign."
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,"Sorry, but you can't flirt your way out of this one, Randy."
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,So that's the story. Where's the proof?
5118,1,2,61,64,1.0625,0.03776362363229024,548,"No, you need a pilot and a pilot car."
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,"Officer, why did you pull me over?.... ... Jet Setting."
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,I was only 500 over the limit!!
5118,1,2,61,64,1.0625,0.03776362363229024,548,"It's twenty dollars for hubris and another twenty for lack of compassion, Sir."
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,"Sir, your car's toxic emissions are killing all of the sheep and cattle."
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,"I was only doing 400 mph in class E airspace, which is legal, sir. Wait, how did you catch up with me?"
5118,1,2,61,64,1.0625,0.03776362363229024,548,"Yeah! I heard this a hundred times, ""…I only had 2 beers Occiffer.."""
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,"Your personal party rocket may rule in outer space, but in this atmosphere crossing the double yellow line is a no-no."
5118,1,2,61,64,1.0625,0.03776362363229024,548,You needed a cigarette break.......!!
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,"Donald, you should have known a gift from Vladi could be dangerous......"
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,Disengage bluster. You're getting this ticket.
5118,1,2,61,64,1.0625,0.03776362363229024,548,"I was just told to land here, officer, because at the airport where I suppose to land, they are on strike!"
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,And do you give me your consent to search?
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,Who do you think your fooling ?
5118,1,2,61,64,1.0625,0.03776362363229024,548,"At least two wheels on the ground Mr Van Dick, no exceptions."
5118,1,2,61,64,1.0625,0.03776362363229024,548,"Sorry Officer! But I""m in such a hurry to get to a Cubs World Series game! I can't wait another 108 years!"
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,Your vehicle is exhausting the traffic limits.
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,"Okay, what's your cock and bull story?"
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,"It's not a plane, and it's not an automobile. So I don't need a stinking registration."
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,"No, I do not know why you pulled me over, isn't this the salt flats?"
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,It wasn't that hard -- my squad car is a Rocket 88.
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,"...well, it's gotta be bituminous macadam legal in this jurisdiction."
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,They don't require licenses on your planet?
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,"I've been on this job for 20 years, but this is a first."
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,You've been speeding since you made a left at Uranus.
5118,1,2,61,64,1.0625,0.03776362363229024,548,are you Batman?
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,"Buddy, you were going over ""c"" not over sea."
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,"I'm sorry but you heard wrong. This is flyover country, not flythrough country."
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,You were clocked driving below the minimum allowable speed.
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,You'd have made escape velocity but for that speed bump.
5118,1,2,61,64,1.0625,0.03776362363229024,548,Just how large are those four cylinders
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,"Sir, do you realize you blasted through that red dwarf?"
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,"Sorry, Sir - Your vehicle is not on our list of acceptable foreign builds."
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,"You were going at the wrong exit velocity, kid. Use context clues next time. You're on a street. Those are trees."
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,I'll let you off with a verbal warning this time.
5118,1,2,61,64,1.0625,0.03776362363229024,548,"Sir, you have to pull over a bit to the head.. ."
5118,1,2,61,64,1.0625,0.03776362363229024,548,You were doing 10 in a 5 MPH zone.

5118,1,2,61,64,1.0625,0.03776362363229024,548,"Officer: Do you know how fast you were going? Jeff: 30,000? Officer: And what is so urgent that you had to go 5,000 over? Jeff: My wife is giving birth on Mars?"
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,"Whats your name son?"" ""Joe"" ""You know how fast you where going?"" ""No"" ""Well you where going 200,000,000,000,000 mph thats a fine of 1.999999 trillion bucks."

5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,Officer I wasn't going more then 200 miles an hour.
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,I'm sorry Mr. Musk but you'll just have to find some other way to recycle your failed rockets.
5118,0,4,60,64,1.0625,0.030496877279641663,548,"Just trying to be like Sully, officer. I couldn't reach LaGuardia or Teeterboro."
