411,8,32,100,140,1.3428571428571427,0.04942779318458915,547,I told you to go before we left.
411,21,6,113,140,1.3428571428571427,0.06147504157821301,547,I can see up her skirt.
411,12,24,104,140,1.3428571428571427,0.053424773567828515,547,I'm beginning to have doubts.

411,8,32,100,140,1.3428571428571427,0.04942779318458915,547,I actually hope it rains on this parade.
411,8,32,100,140,1.3428571428571427,0.04942779318458915,547,That's it for me. No more chasing women.
411,8,32,100,140,1.3428571428571427,0.04942779318458915,547,I thought the piccolo player would have lasted a little longer.
411,12,24,104,140,1.3428571428571427,0.053424773567828515,547,"Oh no, I was crawling long before she showed up."
438,6,34,95,135,1.3407407407407408,0.04837087575300394,547,"Shedding those drums made a world of difference, don't you think?"
439,11,25,103,139,1.3381294964028776,0.05261779892279371,547,She's really more of a 'fantasy' than a 'mirage.'
439,14,19,106,139,1.3381294964028776,0.05551059364792893,547,Burning Man sure looks a lot different in the pictures.
439,10,27,102,139,1.3381294964028776,0.05161751978664064,547,I'm saying it must be a hell of an oasis
439,14,19,106,139,1.3381294964028776,0.05551059364792893,547,What drum majorette?!
439,9,29,101,139,1.3381294964028776,0.05059746964393502,547,Stay in formation!
439,6,35,98,139,1.3381294964028776,0.04740580861775263,547,This is much easier without the tuba.
439,11,25,103,139,1.3381294964028776,0.05261779892279371,547,It just isn't the same without confetti.
439,9,29,101,139,1.3381294964028776,0.05059746964393502,547,This is much better than following the elephants.
439,11,25,103,139,1.3381294964028776,0.05261779892279371,547,May it rain on her parade!
439,9,29,101,139,1.3381294964028776,0.05059746964393502,547,As mirages go...this one's a dandy!
439,11,25,103,139,1.3381294964028776,0.05261779892279371,547,"Are you sure she can get us ""Hamilton"" tickets?"
439,9,29,101,139,1.3381294964028776,0.05059746964393502,547,"You know, it's not sexist to ask her if she's sure this is the right way."
439,9,29,101,139,1.3381294964028776,0.05059746964393502,547,The tuba players are always the first to go.
439,9,29,101,139,1.3381294964028776,0.05059746964393502,547,"That is a divining rod, right?"
453,10,24,97,131,1.3358778625954197,0.053761272860027506,547,She's always been an optimist.
454,7,32,98,137,1.3357664233576643,0.04890094379315699,547,I hope we get back to the stadium in time for the second half.
454,9,28,100,137,1.3357664233576643,0.05104886597930505,547,Next time we follow my Mirage.

454,8,30,99,137,1.3357664233576643,0.04998644327032355,547,Maybe it will rain on her parade.
454,13,20,104,137,1.3357664233576643,0.05509406089222457,547,"Well, we did vote for change."
454,10,26,101,137,1.3357664233576643,0.05208962396417183,547,"I can't help it, I just love a parade."
454,12,22,103,137,1.3357664233576643,0.05411112028631799,547,Having a leader with great stamina and no sense of direction is not working for me.
454,15,16,106,137,1.3357664233576643,0.05700912172194639,547,"""When I started following she was a Clydesdale pulling a beer wagon.""i"
454,11,24,102,137,1.3357664233576643,0.05310999088386854,547,So this one time at band camp...
454,11,24,102,137,1.3357664233576643,0.05310999088386854,547,I still think it's better than last year's Burning Man.
454,12,22,103,137,1.3357664233576643,0.05411112028631799,547,"I'd say she's a few trombones short of 76, wouldn't you?"
454,9,28,100,137,1.3357664233576643,0.05104886597930505,547,I think that for a mirage she keeps cadence quite well.
454,14,18,105,137,1.3357664233576643,0.05605976946574008,547,I hope this mirage knows where's she going!
467,8,31,101,140,1.3357142857142856,0.049260423676337574,547,Seems like a big buildup for a cup of water.
468,14,18,106,138,1.3333333333333333,0.05570521820600417,547,I really hope it rains on this parade.
468,11,23,101,135,1.3333333333333333,0.0536145158268927,547,Keep following. She's the new secretary of the interior
468,9,27,99,135,1.3333333333333333,0.05151116061908372,547,I follow her on Twitter also
468,7,31,97,135,1.3333333333333333,0.04931818152870151,547,"Hallucination or not, she's got spirit."

468,12,23,106,141,1.3333333333333333,0.05294437702368598,547,Best mirage we've ever had!

468,10,25,100,135,1.3333333333333333,0.05257335815637598,547,"She knows we're here, right?"

478,13,19,104,136,1.3308823529411764,0.05528215116422851,547,Funny...A second ago she was wearing underpants.
478,7,31,98,136,1.3308823529411764,0.049015522705595845,547,Is is too late to pick 'truth'?
478,8,29,99,136,1.3308823529411764,0.0501144083869741,547,I still can't tell if she's wearing panties.
478,9,27,100,136,1.3308823529411764,0.05118970980431573,547,"Is it just me, or is she actually picking up the pace?"
478,13,19,104,136,1.3308823529411764,0.05528215116422851,547,"I chose an entertaining leader, not a good one."
478,7,31,98,136,1.3308823529411764,0.049015522705595845,547,She has a lousy sense of direction but I'd follow those legs anywhere.
478,8,29,99,136,1.3308823529411764,0.0501144083869741,547,Is the rest of the band still back there?
478,8,29,99,136,1.3308823529411764,0.0501144083869741,547,Perhaps following the water boy would have been a better idea.
478,11,23,102,136,1.3308823529411764,0.053275241093751376,547,Now you ‘oom’ and I’ll ‘pah.’
478,11,23,102,136,1.3308823529411764,0.053275241093751376,547,Makes you wonder why we're crawling.

478,8,29,99,136,1.3308823529411764,0.0501144083869741,547,This mirage is more up beat than the last one.
478,12,21,103,136,1.3308823529411764,0.054287970817400916,547,It's only when you're close to death that you really learn to appreciate the arts.
478,10,25,101,136,1.3308823529411764,0.052242883263882905,547,I thought we were following her only on Facebook.

478,9,27,100,136,1.3308823529411764,0.05118970980431573,547,Guess what I am hallucinating now.
478,8,29,99,136,1.3308823529411764,0.0501144083869741,547,"As mirages go, one could do worse."

478,13,19,104,136,1.3308823529411764,0.05528215116422851,547,Not the Inauguration parade most of us were expecting.
478,10,25,101,136,1.3308823529411764,0.052242883263882905,547,Are you sure that's a divining rod?
478,7,31,98,136,1.3308823529411764,0.049015522705595845,547,Is she your mirage or mine?
478,13,19,104,136,1.3308823529411764,0.05528215116422851,547,"Bro, Burning Man, am I right?"
478,12,21,103,136,1.3308823529411764,0.054287970817400916,547,I was a drummer. What did you play?
478,10,25,101,136,1.3308823529411764,0.052242883263882905,547,are we there yet ?
478,8,29,99,136,1.3308823529411764,0.0501144083869741,547,"Next year, we're mapping out the parade route online first."
478,9,27,100,136,1.3308823529411764,0.05118970980431573,547,Look the bright side -- at least there aren't any horses.
478,11,23,102,136,1.3308823529411764,0.053275241093751376,547,We ARE the band.
478,10,25,101,136,1.3308823529411764,0.052242883263882905,547,"Get your own mirage, this one's mine!"
478,6,33,97,136,1.3308823529411764,0.047891429340009714,547,Forget the water. I want her optimism.
478,10,25,101,136,1.3308823529411764,0.052242883263882905,547,I agree she's attractive and has lots of energy but I'm starting to think she's not that smart.
509,7,31,99,137,1.3284671532846715,0.04871633554988583,547,I'd follow her anywhere.
509,8,29,100,137,1.3284671532846715,0.049805858655030184,547,There are worse leaders out there.

512,8,28,99,135,1.325925925925926,0.05023948135648348,547,I think we're missing the game.
512,12,20,103,135,1.325925925925926,0.054463187246273276,547,I hope this isn't the baton death march.
512,13,18,104,135,1.325925925925926,0.05546888393086855,547,She motivates me to go the extra mile.

512,5,34,96,135,1.325925925925926,0.04682232937849013,547,Now THERE'S a mirage I can get behind!
512,9,26,100,135,1.325925925925926,0.05132800216725753,547,I was waiting for Godot and she came along.

512,8,28,99,135,1.325925925925926,0.05023948135648348,547,I feel bad about leaving the 76 trombones behind.
512,6,32,97,135,1.325925925925926,0.04798842410354151,547,Maybe it'll finally rain on her parade.
512,10,24,101,135,1.325925925925926,0.0523939130624497,547,Someday we'll be able to tell our grandkids that we survived the baton death march.
512,13,18,104,135,1.325925925925926,0.05546888393086855,547,I think it's time I started marching to the beat of my own drummer.
512,8,28,99,135,1.325925925925926,0.05023948135648348,547,Ask her to spin that baton. We might get a breeze.

512,12,20,103,135,1.325925925925926,0.054463187246273276,547,And to think we were running from clowns a month ago.

642,8,23,96,127,1.3070866141732282,0.051852100226659245,547,How many more measures?
646,8,23,97,128,1.3046875,0.051501320779925364,547,I know we probably shouldn't but how about one more time around
646,7,25,96,128,1.3046875,0.05029268879284324,547,"You know, I sort of wish we had packed a light lunch."
646,7,25,96,128,1.3046875,0.05029268879284324,547,How about next year we try out for Glee Club instead of Marching Band?
646,6,27,95,128,1.3046875,0.04905428676426544,547,I think you should tell her those last two turns were a little unnecessary...
646,12,15,101,128,1.3046875,0.05607594873320237,547,All I have to do is outlast you...
646,7,25,96,128,1.3046875,0.05029268879284324,547,You said she'd lead us to the Promised Band.
646,9,21,98,128,1.3046875,0.05268223171183776,547,I'm no longer sure that I do love a parade.
646,6,27,95,128,1.3046875,0.04905428676426544,547,"No, giving us water would just be enabling."
646,10,19,99,128,1.3046875,0.053837245789534555,547,I'm hoping it will rain on her parade
646,9,21,98,128,1.3046875,0.05268223171183776,547,This is the best mirage ever!
646,9,21,98,128,1.3046875,0.05268223171183776,547,Remember the time when the 'Macy's Parade' was magical?
646,8,23,97,128,1.3046875,0.051501320779925364,547,I love a parade.
646,9,21,98,128,1.3046875,0.05268223171183776,547,How long does half-time usually last?
646,7,25,96,128,1.3046875,0.05029268879284324,547,It helps if you imagine you're playing a tuba.
646,9,21,98,128,1.3046875,0.05268223171183776,547,"Remember its not the journey, its the destination"
646,8,23,97,128,1.3046875,0.051501320779925364,547,That's no illusion. That's my wife.

646,8,23,97,128,1.3046875,0.051501320779925364,547,..and how long have you been a Browns fan?
646,14,11,103,128,1.3046875,0.05822864431235476,547,"Well, it looks like we're the final survivors of this Baton Death March..."
646,7,25,96,128,1.3046875,0.05029268879284324,547,You think the second half has started yet?
646,10,19,99,128,1.3046875,0.053837245789534555,547,Marching to a different drummer isn't all that it's cracked up to be.
646,7,25,96,128,1.3046875,0.05029268879284324,547,She's hearing a different drummer.
646,9,21,98,128,1.3046875,0.05268223171183776,547,This is one time I wish it would rain on my parade!
646,10,19,99,128,1.3046875,0.053837245789534555,547,The view doesn't get any better than this.
646,9,21,98,128,1.3046875,0.05268223171183776,547,"Easy for her, she didn't start out carrying a tuba."
646,12,15,101,128,1.3046875,0.05607594873320237,547,"I said I would follow her anywhere, in sickness and in health. Why are you here?"
646,7,25,96,128,1.3046875,0.05029268879284324,547,Remind me again how the Baton Death March ends?
646,6,27,95,128,1.3046875,0.04905428676426544,547,And the band parches on.
674,4,31,94,129,1.302325581395349,0.046177335493968436,547,"As mirages go, the legs are not bad."

674,9,21,99,129,1.302325581395349,0.05232558139534884,547,Please God let it rain on this parade
674,10,19,100,129,1.302325581395349,0.0534704638035713,547,It's the enthusiasm of the crowds that keep me going.
674,9,21,99,129,1.302325581395349,0.05232558139534884,547,Do you see what I see?
679,5,28,93,126,1.3015873015873016,0.04816616907944171,547,I wonder if she realizes we gave up our tubas miles ago.
679,7,24,95,126,1.3015873015873016,0.05073409206596311,547,I bet you lose your deposit on the drum.
679,6,26,94,126,1.3015873015873016,0.04946679664960623,547,Now you know why I don't like asking for directions.
679,10,18,98,126,1.3015873015873016,0.05435899629969267,547,Ever wonder why the rest of the band isn't following?
679,6,26,94,126,1.3015873015873016,0.04946679664960623,547,"I don't know, I just like parades! You?"
679,8,22,96,126,1.3015873015873016,0.051970493789666346,547,But she looked like she knew where she was going
679,9,20,97,126,1.3015873015873016,0.05317815671613557,547,Are you sure this is Burning Man?
679,9,20,97,126,1.3015873015873016,0.05317815671613557,547,YOU tell her the election is over!

679,5,28,93,126,1.3015873015873016,0.04816616907944171,547,"You conjure your mirage, I'll conjure mine."
679,8,22,96,126,1.3015873015873016,0.051970493789666346,547,"Yeah, you're right! She's not wearing underwear."
679,10,18,98,126,1.3015873015873016,0.05435899629969267,547,I can't believe we're going to be great again!
679,10,18,98,126,1.3015873015873016,0.05435899629969267,547,Did she say mirage or ménage?
679,9,20,97,126,1.3015873015873016,0.05317815671613557,547,I'd do almost anything for my boot fetish.

679,10,18,98,126,1.3015873015873016,0.05435899629969267,547,I wonder if this is a death march
679,8,22,96,126,1.3015873015873016,0.051970493789666346,547,Marching band tryouts are rough this year.
679,10,18,98,126,1.3015873015873016,0.05435899629969267,547,She says she is going to make America great again.
699,9,20,98,127,1.2992125984251968,0.05281118679843102,547,So WHEN is it gonna rain on her parade already?

703,9,19,97,125,1.296,0.053308596413832766,547,I'm beginning to think we've been conned.
703,9,19,97,125,1.296,0.053308596413832766,547,I've always been a sucker for parades.
703,10,17,98,125,1.296,0.05450540073861873,547,This has a baton death march feel to it.

703,9,19,97,125,1.296,0.053308596413832766,547,I told you we should have followed the clown with the dancing dog
703,7,23,95,125,1.296,0.050830521692029396,547,I think women are natural leaders.
703,8,21,96,125,1.296,0.052084298915780626,547,The trombones were the first to go. There were just too many.
703,7,23,95,125,1.296,0.050830521692029396,547,If we both see her? Then we're dead. Or on HBO.
703,10,17,98,125,1.296,0.05450540073861873,547,I thought the team was playing at home.
703,7,23,95,125,1.296,0.050830521692029396,547,Finally a parade route that doesn't block traffic.
703,4,29,92,125,1.296,0.0468683812531468,547,That fabric must really breathe...
703,4,29,92,125,1.296,0.0468683812531468,547,Imagine what we'd do for a cheerleader.
703,7,23,95,125,1.296,0.050830521692029396,547,We should follow her on Twitter.
703,7,23,95,125,1.296,0.050830521692029396,547,It is amazing how far a good pair of legs can take a guy.
703,8,21,96,125,1.296,0.052084298915780626,547,I lost all confidence in her when the trombones died.
703,7,23,95,125,1.296,0.050830521692029396,547,I'd follow her anywhere.
703,10,17,98,125,1.296,0.05450540073861873,547,I get the feeling she's leading us to a major disappointment.
703,7,23,95,125,1.296,0.050830521692029396,547,Nice that we get to go before the horses this year.
703,10,17,98,125,1.296,0.05450540073861873,547,Are you seeing this too?
703,5,27,93,125,1.296,0.04822527780484877,547,There was just something about her brash confidence that inspired me to follow.

734,8,20,95,123,1.2926829268292683,0.05256541061685997,547,What do you mean YOU saw her first?
734,7,22,94,123,1.2926829268292683,0.051281988767931885,547,"Did he say Baton, or Bataan?"
734,9,18,96,123,1.2926829268292683,0.053818234964033325,547,You gotta better idea?
734,7,22,94,123,1.2926829268292683,0.051281988767931885,547,"Is it just me, or is this 'extreme parade experience' starting to lose its shine?"
734,8,20,95,123,1.2926829268292683,0.05256541061685997,547,"No, this was your idea."
734,8,20,95,123,1.2926829268292683,0.05256541061685997,547,I think we can go home now. If she hasn't dropped it yet she probably won't.
734,6,24,93,123,1.2926829268292683,0.04996561168113014,547,Halftime seems to be going on forever.
734,7,22,94,123,1.2926829268292683,0.051281988767931885,547,"Forty years we've been out here, when do we reach the promised band?"
734,9,18,96,123,1.2926829268292683,0.053818234964033325,547,'think she knows she has a run in her pantyhose?
734,7,22,94,123,1.2926829268292683,0.051281988767931885,547,Looks like we're down 74 trombones.
734,8,20,95,123,1.2926829268292683,0.05256541061685997,547,It's certainly a nice change from the oasis mirage.
734,10,16,97,123,1.2926829268292683,0.0550425511397201,547,We should hav traveled to the beat of a different drum major.
734,8,20,95,123,1.2926829268292683,0.05256541061685997,547,Your girlfriend is so upbeat.
734,6,24,93,123,1.2926829268292683,0.04996561168113014,547,"I don't know about you, but I expected more big balloons and floats..."
734,6,24,93,123,1.2926829268292683,0.04996561168113014,547,Did we sign-up for the Baton Death March?
734,10,16,97,123,1.2926829268292683,0.0550425511397201,547,I'm feeling great again. Aren't you feeling great again?
734,6,24,93,123,1.2926829268292683,0.04996561168113014,547,"All I said was ""With legs like those, I'd follow you anywhere!"" What's YOUR excuse?"
734,9,18,96,123,1.2926829268292683,0.053818234964033325,547,So this is what following her to the end of the earth is.
734,5,26,92,123,1.2926829268292683,0.048613602307838545,547,I do like a parade.
734,7,22,94,123,1.2926829268292683,0.051281988767931885,547,Next time I'll pick the mirage.
734,7,22,94,123,1.2926829268292683,0.051281988767931885,547,How's the new leadership working for you?
734,5,26,92,123,1.2926829268292683,0.048613602307838545,547,I’m starting to think she doesn’t want to go to homecoming with either of us.
734,4,28,91,123,1.2926829268292683,0.04722290024998339,547,"I said I would follow her to the ends of the earth. You, too?"
734,7,22,94,123,1.2926829268292683,0.051281988767931885,547,I'm headed for Pasadena. You?
734,7,22,94,123,1.2926829268292683,0.051281988767931885,547,After us come the floats.
734,4,28,91,123,1.2926829268292683,0.04722290024998339,547,I don't think we will make it by halftime.
786,7,22,95,124,1.2903225806451613,0.05092147674264367,547,"Wow, mirages sure have come a long way!"
787,8,19,94,121,1.2892561983471074,0.05305802287932554,547,Your other left.
787,7,21,93,121,1.2892561983471074,0.05174372179338356,547,I think we're almost at Burning Man.
789,8,19,95,122,1.2868852459016393,0.05267471067979411,547,I love a woman in a uniform.
789,4,27,91,122,1.2868852459016393,0.04725138260055944,547,Are you sure she knows the way to San Jose?
789,7,21,94,122,1.2868852459016393,0.05137258167851918,547,At what point are we NOT with her?
789,9,17,96,122,1.2868852459016393,0.053945418175076795,547,"If this is halftime, we're goners."
789,10,15,97,122,1.2868852459016393,0.055186874698317505,547,"You know, of course, this is pretty much how we wound up voting for Trump, don't you?"
789,3,29,90,122,1.2868852459016393,0.04579530719168242,547,And to think an hour ago we were at a spa sipping Mojitos; she's good--she's very good.
789,8,19,95,122,1.2868852459016393,0.05267471067979411,547,We should have stayed on the bus with the band!
789,5,25,92,122,1.2868852459016393,0.04866391018556094,547,Appears that Hillary's following thinned out after the election
789,7,21,94,122,1.2868852459016393,0.05137258167851918,547,These pep rally tryouts are more gruelling than I expected
789,10,15,97,122,1.2868852459016393,0.055186874698317505,547,Love the new GPS!
789,6,23,93,122,1.2868852459016393,0.05003657813472293,547,Worst threesome ever.
789,9,17,96,122,1.2868852459016393,0.053945418175076795,547,"Well, at least its not raining!"
789,5,25,92,122,1.2868852459016393,0.04866391018556094,547,Seems a bit intense for a dress rehersal
789,4,27,91,122,1.2868852459016393,0.04725138260055944,547,I think these half time shows are way too long
789,10,15,97,122,1.2868852459016393,0.055186874698317505,547,I think I left the stove on.
789,5,25,92,122,1.2868852459016393,0.04866391018556094,547,Your wife's a real trooper.
789,3,29,90,122,1.2868852459016393,0.04579530719168242,547,At least we won't be starved for entertainment.
789,8,19,95,122,1.2868852459016393,0.05267471067979411,547,I'd have preferred a marsh.
789,7,21,94,122,1.2868852459016393,0.05137258167851918,547,Well if she's a mirage how do you explain the marching band?
789,6,23,93,122,1.2868852459016393,0.05003657813472293,547,How far away is Macy's.
789,7,21,94,122,1.2868852459016393,0.05137258167851918,547,You know how I usually tell you not to rain on my parade?
789,7,21,94,122,1.2868852459016393,0.05137258167851918,547,I guess I've always been a follower.
789,9,17,96,122,1.2868852459016393,0.053945418175076795,547,"You say Baton, I say Bataan .... let's call the whole thing off!"
789,6,23,93,122,1.2868852459016393,0.05003657813472293,547,"Neither did they believe in Moses , when he walked out on Egypt..."
789,6,23,93,122,1.2868852459016393,0.05003657813472293,547,I haven't heard a drum since Tuesday.
789,9,17,96,122,1.2868852459016393,0.053945418175076795,547,"I'll say it again. A musical half-time salute to ""Ishtar"" is a bad idea."
789,9,17,96,122,1.2868852459016393,0.053945418175076795,547,I think she’s lost
789,5,25,92,122,1.2868852459016393,0.04866391018556094,547,Does it seem like the Thanksgiving Day Parade gets longer each year?
789,8,19,95,122,1.2868852459016393,0.05267471067979411,547,Can't wait until we're great again
789,7,21,94,122,1.2868852459016393,0.05137258167851918,547,I see you're having the same weird dream I am.
789,3,29,90,122,1.2868852459016393,0.04579530719168242,547,What happened to the different drummer
789,8,19,95,122,1.2868852459016393,0.05267471067979411,547,"I take it back. This parade could use some rain, after all."
789,5,25,92,122,1.2868852459016393,0.04866391018556094,547,Funny you should ask...I do still love a parade.
789,5,25,92,122,1.2868852459016393,0.04866391018556094,547,What if it turns out she is just a cactus?
789,8,19,95,122,1.2868852459016393,0.05267471067979411,547,It's gotta be a metaphor for something or other.
789,7,21,94,122,1.2868852459016393,0.05137258167851918,547,We thought we had trouble back in River City.
789,9,17,96,122,1.2868852459016393,0.053945418175076795,547,When the hell is she gonna pass the baton?
789,7,21,94,122,1.2868852459016393,0.05137258167851918,547,"First the rats, then the children, now us"

828,4,27,92,123,1.2845528455284554,0.04692365390058747,547,I love halftime!
828,7,21,95,123,1.2845528455284554,0.05100656192448701,547,It's still better than the election.
828,5,25,93,123,1.2845528455284554,0.048322968831673835,547,Is this your mirage or my mirage?
831,5,24,91,120,1.2833333333333334,0.04905740839459444,547,Please...rain on our parade.
831,10,14,96,120,1.2833333333333334,0.05573965760963053,547,I think we took a wrong turn back at the fifty.
833,10,15,99,124,1.282258064516129,0.05439084482625438,547,You have to get passed her.
833,11,13,100,124,1.282258064516129,0.05558321999016594,547,Let's try to think of it as a resume builder.
835,6,22,93,121,1.28099173553719,0.05010064319414108,547,"The ""Baton"" Death March"
835,11,12,98,121,1.28099173553719,0.05655775528277633,547,I'm beginning to think that she is a miragerette.
835,6,22,93,121,1.28099173553719,0.05010064319414108,547,I think we made a wrong turn after the Snoopy float.
835,7,20,94,121,1.28099173553719,0.05145692854512977,547,I don't care if she's a mirage -- I'm joining the band.
835,8,18,95,121,1.28099173553719,0.05277837191625511,547,"When the band stops playing, then worry."
835,7,20,94,121,1.28099173553719,0.05145692854512977,547,"I don't know what I want more, water or a slide trombone."
835,10,14,97,121,1.28099173553719,0.055326653936366495,547,I'd like to rain on her parade.
835,3,28,90,121,1.28099173553719,0.045791389015520885,547,"Last year's parade was bigger, wasn't it?"
835,10,14,97,121,1.28099173553719,0.055326653936366495,547,She still thinks Hillary is going to win.
835,8,18,95,121,1.28099173553719,0.05277837191625511,547,"She got us into this, and she can get us out."
835,6,22,93,121,1.28099173553719,0.05010064319414108,547,I believed her when she said it always rained on her parade. Now what?
835,7,20,94,121,1.28099173553719,0.05145692854512977,547,How many times now?? It's LEFT RIGHT LEFT Stan -- how is that so difficult?
835,8,18,95,121,1.28099173553719,0.05277837191625511,547,Beware of the Ida of march.
835,9,16,96,121,1.28099173553719,0.05406752804560703,547,"Well, you just have to trust your leaders..."
835,9,16,96,121,1.28099173553719,0.05406752804560703,547,"Sure it feels like a campaign promise, but imagine if it pays off."
835,7,20,94,121,1.28099173553719,0.05145692854512977,547,I love the way she splashes through the mirages.
835,6,22,93,121,1.28099173553719,0.05010064319414108,547,This is the best mirage we have had yet.
835,7,20,94,121,1.28099173553719,0.05145692854512977,547,I'm sure it'll be great again any minute.
835,8,18,95,121,1.28099173553719,0.05277837191625511,547,"Remember, she can't make us drink."
835,7,20,94,121,1.28099173553719,0.05145692854512977,547,I like to see a woman exhibiting leadership qualities.
835,8,18,95,121,1.28099173553719,0.05277837191625511,547,This is the worst half-time hallucination ever.
835,13,8,100,121,1.28099173553719,0.05894286874839336,547,I told you that America would become great again!

835,7,20,94,121,1.28099173553719,0.05145692854512977,547,I think you're offbeat.
835,4,26,91,121,1.28099173553719,0.04727147506480756,547,"Why you say? I'll tell you why, because I've always been a leg man."
835,8,18,95,121,1.28099173553719,0.05277837191625511,547,I didn't think the hazing for cheerleader would be so difficult.
835,10,14,97,121,1.28099173553719,0.055326653936366495,547,It's not my fault. I thought she said we were going for desert.
862,8,19,98,125,1.28,0.05155642070711495,547,There has to be a football game around here somewhere!

864,7,20,95,122,1.278688524590164,0.051085354697474245,547,It was better with the band . . .
864,7,20,95,122,1.278688524590164,0.051085354697474245,547,This halftime show has taken several strange turns.
866,8,17,94,119,1.2773109243697478,0.053271240460810235,547,"Oh yeah, I'm still with her."

866,8,17,94,119,1.2773109243697478,0.053271240460810235,547,Is it just me or is this mirage hot?
866,7,19,93,119,1.2773109243697478,0.0519171956767333,547,I'm here because she promises to create jobs.
866,7,19,93,119,1.2773109243697478,0.0519171956767333,547,I've got rhythm!
866,4,25,90,119,1.2773109243697478,0.047624632775953885,547,"Keep up the pace, you're making us look bad!"
866,5,23,91,119,1.2773109243697478,0.04909720460822299,547,I think this is the stage they call march madness.
866,5,23,91,119,1.2773109243697478,0.04909720460822299,547,Her workout sessions really make you feel the burn.
866,7,19,93,119,1.2773109243697478,0.0519171956767333,547,I don't think her stamina was the issue.
866,6,21,92,119,1.2773109243697478,0.050526877536999686,547,The Macy's parade really doesn't work in other places.
866,7,19,93,119,1.2773109243697478,0.0519171956767333,547,Does your mirage have epaulettes too?
866,9,15,95,119,1.2773109243697478,0.05459171103318449,547,I'm not sure her enthusiasm makes up for her lack of topographical expertise.
866,6,21,92,119,1.2773109243697478,0.050526877536999686,547,Can't you keep in step?
866,7,19,93,119,1.2773109243697478,0.0519171956767333,547,"Is it me, or is halftime taking longer than usual?"
866,10,13,96,119,1.2773109243697478,0.05588098752552578,547,"You have to admit, it's a catchy tune."
866,8,17,94,119,1.2773109243697478,0.053271240460810235,547,I hear she's one of the top picks for Secretary of Transportation.
866,6,21,92,119,1.2773109243697478,0.050526877536999686,547,"Mirage or not, If she drops the baton she'll have to bend over to pick it up."
866,6,21,92,119,1.2773109243697478,0.050526877536999686,547,"Well, I guess what happened didn't actually stay in Vegas...."
866,7,19,93,119,1.2773109243697478,0.0519171956767333,547,Ask her if she takes requests.
866,5,23,91,119,1.2773109243697478,0.04909720460822299,547,I thought there would be more spectators.
866,8,17,94,119,1.2773109243697478,0.053271240460810235,547,Whaddya bet the glockenspiels and tubas are yukking it up over tequilas right now back in Albuquerque.
866,8,17,94,119,1.2773109243697478,0.053271240460810235,547,How can this be a mirage? Look at those boots!
866,3,27,89,119,1.2773109243697478,0.046105051716132044,547,What happened to the other 74 guys and our trombones?
866,3,27,89,119,1.2773109243697478,0.046105051716132044,547,"She might have a lousy sense of direction, but just look at those thighs!"
866,10,13,96,119,1.2773109243697478,0.05588098752552578,547,"Look on the bright side, traffic was much worse during his first inaugural parade."
866,8,17,94,119,1.2773109243697478,0.053271240460810235,547,I love the silence of this place.
866,5,23,91,119,1.2773109243697478,0.04909720460822299,547,"What, you couldn't have imagined a drinking fountain?"
866,6,21,92,119,1.2773109243697478,0.050526877536999686,547,"You realize the parade ended about 1,000 miles ago right?"
866,6,21,92,119,1.2773109243697478,0.050526877536999686,547,Tell me again why we signed up for Band Boot Camp.
866,7,19,93,119,1.2773109243697478,0.0519171956767333,547,Dibs on the hat.
866,5,23,91,119,1.2773109243697478,0.04909720460822299,547,Sure glad we ditched the tubas!
866,8,17,94,119,1.2773109243697478,0.053271240460810235,547,But I don't hear any drums.
866,6,21,92,119,1.2773109243697478,0.050526877536999686,547,I'll trade you 76 trombones for one glass of water.
866,8,17,94,119,1.2773109243697478,0.053271240460810235,547,"Okay, one more mile. But that's it."
866,10,13,96,119,1.2773109243697478,0.05588098752552578,547,"I'm telling you, this isn't the yellow brick road."
866,7,19,93,119,1.2773109243697478,0.0519171956767333,547,You have really weird hallucinations.
866,5,23,91,119,1.2773109243697478,0.04909720460822299,547,You were right: This is easier without the sousaphones.
866,5,23,91,119,1.2773109243697478,0.04909720460822299,547,Do you even remember what parade this is?
866,5,23,91,119,1.2773109243697478,0.04909720460822299,547,The world is full of unlikely leaders.
866,7,19,93,119,1.2773109243697478,0.0519171956767333,547,"What do you mean, out of step?"
866,8,17,94,119,1.2773109243697478,0.053271240460810235,547,These triathlons are getting out of hand.
866,7,19,93,119,1.2773109243697478,0.0519171956767333,547,I'm not that thirsty. I just love a parade.
866,5,23,91,119,1.2773109243697478,0.04909720460822299,547,"I figure where there's halftime, there should be beverages."
866,8,17,94,119,1.2773109243697478,0.053271240460810235,547,"No, you tell her the last of the marching band died off five miles back."
866,5,23,91,119,1.2773109243697478,0.04909720460822299,547,I used to love a parade!
866,2,29,88,119,1.2773109243697478,0.044533649529877505,547,I like her confidence.
866,6,21,92,119,1.2773109243697478,0.050526877536999686,547,You're right. They always look sexier from a distance.
866,8,17,94,119,1.2773109243697478,0.053271240460810235,547,How drunk were we when we promised to follow her to the ends of the earth?
866,3,27,89,119,1.2773109243697478,0.046105051716132044,547,Mirage or fake news?
866,4,25,90,119,1.2773109243697478,0.047624632775953885,547,"I""m not one to complain, but wasn't last years parade shorter?"
916,3,26,89,118,1.271186440677966,0.04608537346042869,547,How much longer until we admit global warming is real?
916,5,22,91,118,1.271186440677966,0.04912830905166196,547,I'm beginning to think she's a mirage.
916,8,16,94,118,1.271186440677966,0.05336838394787918,547,"See, all we needed was a little distraction."
916,10,12,96,118,1.271186440677966,0.05601708229189266,547,She'll ask for directions.
916,5,22,91,118,1.271186440677966,0.04912830905166196,547,"Hey, get your own mirage mister."
916,6,20,92,118,1.271186440677966,0.05058117537107875,547,I just wish she'd change the tempo.
916,7,18,93,118,1.271186440677966,0.05199345971912271,547,"Well, at least the view is nice."
916,4,24,90,118,1.271186440677966,0.04763114735791484,547,We should get there by halftime.
916,3,26,89,118,1.271186440677966,0.04608537346042869,547,I'm afraid the parade has passed us by.
916,4,24,90,118,1.271186440677966,0.04763114735791484,547,Now I wish we'd gone a head and jumped on the bandwagon!
916,8,16,94,118,1.271186440677966,0.05336838394787918,547,See what happens when you ask for directions?
916,8,16,94,118,1.271186440677966,0.05336838394787918,547,"Rain on her parade...rain on her parade, enough already!"
916,7,18,93,118,1.271186440677966,0.05199345971912271,547,I miss the old days when my travel agent planned my vacations.
916,7,18,93,118,1.271186440677966,0.05199345971912271,547,The view from here isn't all that bad.
916,7,18,93,118,1.271186440677966,0.05199345971912271,547,"You'll be the flute for a while, and I'll be the drum"
916,8,16,94,118,1.271186440677966,0.05336838394787918,547,I stopped hearing it a long time ago too.
916,7,18,93,118,1.271186440677966,0.05199345971912271,547,Hear that Roy? We're going to the Inauguration!
916,5,22,91,118,1.271186440677966,0.04912830905166196,547,It's times like this I really wish I wasn't a 'legs' man..
916,4,24,90,118,1.271186440677966,0.04763114735791484,547,I'm beginning to feel like a third wheel here. You go on without me.
916,6,20,92,118,1.271186440677966,0.05058117537107875,547,"Think how screwed we'd be, if Global Warming was REAL!"
916,8,16,94,118,1.271186440677966,0.05336838394787918,547,I voted for Trump. What are you being punished for?
916,3,26,89,118,1.271186440677966,0.04608537346042869,547,It's time we crawl to the beat of our own drum
916,5,22,91,118,1.271186440677966,0.04912830905166196,547,"What happened in Vegas, stays in Vegas, right?"
916,8,16,94,118,1.271186440677966,0.05336838394787918,547,Is she taking the long way?
916,6,20,92,118,1.271186440677966,0.05058117537107875,547,When do you think she’ll realize that everyone else is dead?
916,4,24,90,118,1.271186440677966,0.04763114735791484,547,Cross off 'Marching Band' on my bucket list.
916,6,20,92,118,1.271186440677966,0.05058117537107875,547,Are we not entertained?
916,6,20,92,118,1.271186440677966,0.05058117537107875,547,And how is marching to a different drummer working out for you?
916,5,22,91,118,1.271186440677966,0.04912830905166196,547,Nice boots.
916,5,22,91,118,1.271186440677966,0.04912830905166196,547,I think we got trouble right here in Desert City.
916,6,20,92,118,1.271186440677966,0.05058117537107875,547,"I knew climate change would impact the Rose Parade, but this is ridiculous."
916,6,20,92,118,1.271186440677966,0.05058117537107875,547,We lost the other 74 trombones miles ago...
916,4,24,90,118,1.271186440677966,0.04763114735791484,547,My buddy told me all the best action in Vegas is off The Strip.
916,9,14,95,118,1.271186440677966,0.054708764899716586,547,Thoreau's different drummer led him to a pond.
916,5,22,91,118,1.271186440677966,0.04912830905166196,547,When's halftime over?
916,3,26,89,118,1.271186440677966,0.04608537346042869,547,Who doesn't love a parade ?
916,6,20,92,118,1.271186440677966,0.05058117537107875,547,"Maybe she's taking this ""Road Less Traveled"" thing too far?"
916,5,22,91,118,1.271186440677966,0.04912830905166196,547,Ever think – maybe we should've let the parade pass us by?
916,5,22,91,118,1.271186440677966,0.04912830905166196,547,"The Scots don't either, under THEIR kilts."
955,3,26,90,119,1.26890756302521,0.04575324880937461,547,They are nice boots but that's not the point.
955,9,14,96,119,1.26890756302521,0.05429492514403207,547,I'm starting to believe that ISN'T a divining rod.
955,5,22,92,119,1.26890756302521,0.04876699173833713,547,Don't let their welcoming committee fool you--it's a dry county.
955,8,16,95,119,1.26890756302521,0.05296705620570955,547,Could be worse. She could be wearing boxers.
955,8,16,95,119,1.26890756302521,0.05296705620570955,547,I'm starting to think we should have stayed with the rest of the band.
955,8,16,95,119,1.26890756302521,0.05296705620570955,547,This is way better than the spin class mirage!
955,7,18,94,119,1.26890756302521,0.05160503066370123,547,"Man, these tryouts for The Music Man are getting tougher and tougher."
962,5,21,90,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04952209178050024,547,At least we're ahead of the trombones.
962,7,17,92,116,1.2672413793103448,0.052462249754264334,547,How much farther before we decide we've been duped?
962,5,21,90,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04952209178050024,547,"She may be a mirage, but she’s a damn good mirage."
962,4,23,89,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04798450309042525,547,She said the football game is just around the next dune.
962,4,23,89,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04798450309042525,547,I just love a parade....even if it's a mirage.
962,6,19,91,116,1.2672413793103448,0.05101335719002964,547,I love a strong leader.
962,4,23,89,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04798450309042525,547,"I could use a little less pageantry, a little more water."
962,7,17,92,116,1.2672413793103448,0.052462249754264334,547,All my life I just wanted to be in a cartoon.
962,5,21,90,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04952209178050024,547,Maybe someone will rain on her parade.
962,4,23,89,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04798450309042525,547,Don't tell me. You love a parade too?
962,7,17,92,116,1.2672413793103448,0.052462249754264334,547,Do you think she knows we're desperate?
962,4,23,89,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04798450309042525,547,It's only halftime
962,6,19,91,116,1.2672413793103448,0.05101335719002964,547,I'm beginning to think that's not a divining rod.
962,8,15,93,116,1.2672413793103448,0.053872188434850754,547,It's good to be great again.
962,5,21,90,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04952209178050024,547,Her enthusiasm is really catching.
962,5,21,90,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04952209178050024,547,I don't want water as much as I want her to stop humming that same dang tune.
962,6,19,91,116,1.2672413793103448,0.05101335719002964,547,Maybe we should sing a faster song.
962,8,15,93,116,1.2672413793103448,0.053872188434850754,547,I know they said these were off-Broadway prices but this is ridiculous!
962,4,23,89,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04798450309042525,547,"I'm all for school spirit, but this is ridiculous."
962,9,13,94,116,1.2672413793103448,0.055246155741746655,547,Good call on the choice of mirage
962,3,25,88,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04639598581077646,547,I am beginning to suspect she might be marching to a different drummer.
962,5,21,90,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04952209178050024,547,Maybe we should think about marching to the beat of our own drummer.
962,5,21,90,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04952209178050024,547,You sure she said Rosebowl?
962,8,15,93,116,1.2672413793103448,0.053872188434850754,547,Now this is the way to die!
962,5,21,90,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04952209178050024,547,"""i'm with her"" hasn't been working out so well."
962,4,23,89,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04798450309042525,547,I'm starting to hate John Phillip Sousa.
962,5,21,90,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04952209178050024,547,"""We're going to perform at the Mirage Bowl""."
962,6,19,91,116,1.2672413793103448,0.05101335719002964,547,I thought it was your mirage.
962,6,19,91,116,1.2672413793103448,0.05101335719002964,547,This is a really lousy band camp!
962,5,21,90,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04952209178050024,547,You and your no frills travel guide.
962,2,27,87,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04475111687849267,547,I guess we are both skirt chasers.
962,7,17,92,116,1.2672413793103448,0.052462249754264334,547,"Sing ""I love a parade"" one more time and you're toast!"
962,4,23,89,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04798450309042525,547,I just don't have the heart to tell her the parade ended two hours ago.
962,4,23,89,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04798450309042525,547,I like these new motivational mirages.
962,5,21,90,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04952209178050024,547,Wait til she notices we dropped our tubas a couple of miles back.
962,7,17,92,116,1.2672413793103448,0.052462249754264334,547,"See what I mean? Without leadership, I'd have gone around the left side of those rocks."
962,4,23,89,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04798450309042525,547,"Man, this is a long half-time."
962,7,17,92,116,1.2672413793103448,0.052462249754264334,547,We only have to do this for four years. I hope.
962,5,21,90,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04952209178050024,547,I had no choice but to ditch my tuba.
962,8,15,93,116,1.2672413793103448,0.053872188434850754,547,"Wait a minute, did she ever say specifically how she plans to march America great again?"
962,6,19,91,116,1.2672413793103448,0.05101335719002964,547,So what was it that made you take up the trombone?
962,8,15,93,116,1.2672413793103448,0.053872188434850754,547,I'd follow a woman in boots anywhere!
962,7,17,92,116,1.2672413793103448,0.052462249754264334,547,I don't think she knows where she's going. She just likes to lead.
962,5,21,90,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04952209178050024,547,It's not stalking if we believe we're in a parade.
962,8,15,93,116,1.2672413793103448,0.053872188434850754,547,Other than that stretch where we spelled 'Ohio' I'd say we've made real good time.
962,5,21,90,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04952209178050024,547,She sure knows how to boost morale.
962,6,19,91,116,1.2672413793103448,0.05101335719002964,547,At what point did we go from marching to crawling?
962,5,21,90,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04952209178050024,547,Did you mail in your absentee ballot?
962,7,17,92,116,1.2672413793103448,0.052462249754264334,547,We're duned.
962,9,13,94,116,1.2672413793103448,0.055246155741746655,547,At least now we aren't the only ones who deeply regret having blindly followed the loudest person around.
962,3,25,88,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04639598581077646,547,You meant it - her legs are to die for.
962,2,27,87,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04475111687849267,547,And if she could march in a straight line she'd be perfect.
962,5,21,90,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04952209178050024,547,"I can't help it, I'm a natural born follower."
962,7,17,92,116,1.2672413793103448,0.052462249754264334,547,I've always admired women in uniform.
962,6,19,91,116,1.2672413793103448,0.05101335719002964,547,Please tell me again just why we're following her.
962,2,27,87,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04475111687849267,547,I thought YOU were watching the street signs.
962,8,15,93,116,1.2672413793103448,0.053872188434850754,547,"Since it was only a 2-credit course, I figured, 'how tough could it be'?"
962,6,19,91,116,1.2672413793103448,0.05101335719002964,547,With this new app it may take longer but I never sit in traffic.
962,8,15,93,116,1.2672413793103448,0.053872188434850754,547,"It's not too late to turn back, is it?"
962,5,21,90,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04952209178050024,547,Every once in a while she drops it.
962,5,21,90,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04952209178050024,547,For an extra forty dollars she came with my GPS.
962,6,19,91,116,1.2672413793103448,0.05101335719002964,547,Which bathroom are you going to use?
962,4,23,89,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04798450309042525,547,I hope she's leading us to water and not salted peanuts.
962,6,19,91,116,1.2672413793103448,0.05101335719002964,547,Mirage or no mirage; she's a tall drink of water. That's good enough for me.
962,6,19,91,116,1.2672413793103448,0.05101335719002964,547,"I know she's just a mirage, but she keeps impeccable timing."
962,7,17,92,116,1.2672413793103448,0.052462249754264334,547,I crawl to the beat of a different drum.
962,3,25,88,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04639598581077646,547,"March to a different beat, they said--it will be fun, they said..."
962,7,17,92,116,1.2672413793103448,0.052462249754264334,547,Everybody loves a parade.
962,5,21,90,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04952209178050024,547,I don't know where she gets her optimism.
962,7,17,92,116,1.2672413793103448,0.052462249754264334,547,Im enjoying this mirage a lot more than the one of the swamp.
962,9,13,94,116,1.2672413793103448,0.055246155741746655,547,Nice ass
962,6,19,91,116,1.2672413793103448,0.05101335719002964,547,"If the next song isn't Handel's Water Music, I'm giving up."
962,3,25,88,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04639598581077646,547,"Maybe she is a mirage, but it sure takes your mind off being thirsty."
962,5,21,90,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04952209178050024,547,But would you also swim the deepest ocean for her?
962,5,21,90,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04952209178050024,547,"Is that all you can think of. You lost your clarinet,"
962,5,21,90,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04952209178050024,547,Better rain on my parade!
962,7,17,92,116,1.2672413793103448,0.052462249754264334,547,I'm a follower. You?
962,7,17,92,116,1.2672413793103448,0.052462249754264334,547,Up for a drink after band?
962,4,23,89,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04798450309042525,547,"She's good, but this music is fantastic."
962,8,15,93,116,1.2672413793103448,0.053872188434850754,547,"I don't care how much tickets cost. Next time, I'm jumping on the band wagon."
962,6,19,91,116,1.2672413793103448,0.05101335719002964,547,Best company retreat ever.
962,7,17,92,116,1.2672413793103448,0.052462249754264334,547,Somebody tell the consultant that the rest of us think these company retreats suck.
962,3,25,88,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04639598581077646,547,I can't wait for the half-time show.
962,6,19,91,116,1.2672413793103448,0.05101335719002964,547,Who won the game?
962,4,23,89,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04798450309042525,547,I must admit I was a little suspicious when she wanted us to join her for a drink
962,6,19,91,116,1.2672413793103448,0.05101335719002964,547,"I can't hear the drums anymore, can you ?"
962,6,19,91,116,1.2672413793103448,0.05101335719002964,547,It's the end of the road for this ol' skirt chaser.
962,4,23,89,116,1.2672413793103448,0.04798450309042525,547,"I like the take-charge type, too."
962,10,11,95,116,1.2672413793103448,0.05658677196768328,547,I told you orchestra was better than marching band.
1051,6,19,92,117,1.264957264957265,0.05062701807537747,547,Do we still end up at 34th street?
1051,4,23,90,117,1.264957264957265,0.04762741360339789,547,She's a lot more attractive than our last GPS system.
1053,6,18,91,115,1.2608695652173914,0.05105590857499128,547,At least we got to drop our drums in Tucson.
1053,7,16,92,115,1.2608695652173914,0.0525286693312765,547,This mirage has much better legs than your typical distant pool of water.
1053,8,14,93,115,1.2608695652173914,0.053961249086833675,547,Who else are we gonna follow?
1053,5,20,90,115,1.2608695652173914,0.04953938331389631,547,I've always been a sucker for parades.
1053,7,16,92,115,1.2608695652173914,0.0525286693312765,547,"Next stop, River City!"
1053,7,16,92,115,1.2608695652173914,0.0525286693312765,547,"She was very fairly elected to be our drum major, now just give her a chance."
1053,7,16,92,115,1.2608695652173914,0.0525286693312765,547,I almost lost her at the last stoplight.
1053,4,22,89,115,1.2608695652173914,0.04797494343742813,547,This once I hope it does rain on your parade.
1053,8,14,93,115,1.2608695652173914,0.053961249086833675,547,"Tell me honestly, Leon, do you think it is remotely possible that we should be marching to a different drummer?"
1053,7,16,92,115,1.2608695652173914,0.0525286693312765,547,I don't have the heart to tell her we haven't been marching for at least 20 miles.
1053,5,20,90,115,1.2608695652173914,0.04953938331389631,547,"You know, so much of life comes down to finding the right cadence..."
1053,9,12,94,115,1.2608695652173914,0.05535676746620984,547,This isn't how I pictured the final round of interviews to play out.
1053,5,20,90,115,1.2608695652173914,0.04953938331389631,547,We should have marched to the beat of our own drummer.
1053,7,16,92,115,1.2608695652173914,0.0525286693312765,547,No more discount guided tours for me.
1053,6,18,91,115,1.2608695652173914,0.05105590857499128,547,She's making the desert great again.
1053,5,20,90,115,1.2608695652173914,0.04953938331389631,547,So this is what goes on at band camp!
1053,7,16,92,115,1.2608695652173914,0.0525286693312765,547,"Oh yeah, it's real. The hips don't lie."
1053,8,14,93,115,1.2608695652173914,0.053961249086833675,547,I bet she doesn't realize how ridiculous she looks.
1053,3,24,88,115,1.2608695652173914,0.04635773825940722,547,"Don't worry, Pasadena is just over the next ridge."
1053,4,22,89,115,1.2608695652173914,0.04797494343742813,547,I'm not so sure that's a dowsing rod.
1053,7,16,92,115,1.2608695652173914,0.0525286693312765,547,"Mirage? Ok, so what!"
1053,5,20,90,115,1.2608695652173914,0.04953938331389631,547,Think we might arrive by game-time?
1053,2,26,87,115,1.2608695652173914,0.044682038843711996,547,It's worth it on the off-chance she's not a mirage.
1053,5,20,90,115,1.2608695652173914,0.04953938331389631,547,You were right. It's not a divining rod.
1053,9,12,94,115,1.2608695652173914,0.05535676746620984,547,Nice tall drink of water!
1053,6,18,91,115,1.2608695652173914,0.05105590857499128,547,When is she going to pass the baton?
1053,3,24,88,115,1.2608695652173914,0.04635773825940722,547,Didn't she say she was going to Burning Man?
1053,8,14,93,115,1.2608695652173914,0.053961249086833675,547,"Still, quite a death march."
1053,8,14,93,115,1.2608695652173914,0.053961249086833675,547,I just love a parade.
1053,10,10,95,115,1.2608695652173914,0.05671796016787582,547,"Just you remember, she'll make Arizona great again."
1053,8,14,93,115,1.2608695652173914,0.053961249086833675,547,Now do you understand why dad left her?
1053,6,18,91,115,1.2608695652173914,0.05105590857499128,547,Any chance this figment of your imagination could march a little slower?
1053,2,26,87,115,1.2608695652173914,0.044682038843711996,547,"It's not as much fun as when I was a kid, somehow."
1053,5,20,90,115,1.2608695652173914,0.04953938331389631,547,This had better be a frickin' great oasis.
1053,3,24,88,115,1.2608695652173914,0.04635773825940722,547,I was in the trombone section.
1053,5,20,90,115,1.2608695652173914,0.04953938331389631,547,"Thank God, she didn't make us bring the tubas."
1053,6,18,91,115,1.2608695652173914,0.05105590857499128,547,...sure wish it would rain on my parade.
1053,6,18,91,115,1.2608695652173914,0.05105590857499128,547,"I don't know about you, but dying of thirst, exposure and starvation doesn't seem so bad when you have a little pep in your step."
1053,6,18,91,115,1.2608695652173914,0.05105590857499128,547,I'm tired of crawling in cadence.
1053,5,20,90,115,1.2608695652173914,0.04953938331389631,547,"Yes, yes I know, we'll just follow the gps next time."
1053,7,16,92,115,1.2608695652173914,0.0525286693312765,547,That was a tricky set of turns
1053,4,22,89,115,1.2608695652173914,0.04797494343742813,547,"Truth is, I don't love a parade."
1053,7,16,92,115,1.2608695652173914,0.0525286693312765,547,Even my delusion is delusional.
1053,5,20,90,115,1.2608695652173914,0.04953938331389631,547,"I know it's a mirage, but what the hell."
1053,3,24,88,115,1.2608695652173914,0.04635773825940722,547,I don't think this is going to end well!
1053,5,20,90,115,1.2608695652173914,0.04953938331389631,547,I'm still hoping it'll rain on our parade...
1053,10,10,95,115,1.2608695652173914,0.05671796016787582,547,I was a Senator. You?
1053,7,16,92,115,1.2608695652173914,0.0525286693312765,547,At least she's not making us spell out Ohio.
1053,10,10,95,115,1.2608695652173914,0.05671796016787582,547,I feel really good about this decision.
1102,6,18,92,116,1.2586206896551724,0.05066379415575519,547,I hate to rain on your parade but what drum majorette?
1103,5,19,89,113,1.2566371681415929,0.04993478848271368,547,"I know she's not real, but the heels are a nice touch"
1103,3,23,87,113,1.2566371681415929,0.046662913271925226,547,These Half-Time Shows keep getting longer and longer.
1103,4,21,88,113,1.2566371681415929,0.04832654847926019,547,"I know, next time we use the GPS"
1103,5,19,89,113,1.2566371681415929,0.04993478848271368,547,I'm hoping she's headed for River City.
1103,5,19,89,113,1.2566371681415929,0.04993478848271368,547,I can't wait for halftime to end.
1103,5,19,89,113,1.2566371681415929,0.04993478848271368,547,Are we sure it's a divining rod?
1103,7,15,91,113,1.2566371681415929,0.053005082082791775,547,This has been an unusually warm march.
1103,6,17,90,113,1.2566371681415929,0.051492823904971695,547,This ain't nothing yet. Wait 'til you see the wall!
1103,5,19,89,113,1.2566371681415929,0.04993478848271368,547,So when did you join Crossfit?
1103,7,15,91,113,1.2566371681415929,0.053005082082791775,547,"Come on, sing it with me! 'On Wisconsin, on Wisconsin!'"
1103,7,15,91,113,1.2566371681415929,0.053005082082791775,547,"Frankly, I'd rather be water-boarded."
1103,3,23,87,113,1.2566371681415929,0.046662913271925226,547,"""Uh Oh, it looks like it might rain on our parade."
1103,5,19,89,113,1.2566371681415929,0.04993478848271368,547,I played the clarinet. You?
1103,6,17,90,113,1.2566371681415929,0.051492823904971695,547,I love a parade.
1103,5,19,89,113,1.2566371681415929,0.04993478848271368,547,I think we're victims of March Madness.
1103,7,15,91,113,1.2566371681415929,0.053005082082791775,547,Band Camp must be tougher than we thought.
1103,5,19,89,113,1.2566371681415929,0.04993478848271368,547,"Seriously Bro, I think she's over you."
1103,4,21,88,113,1.2566371681415929,0.04832654847926019,547,Did you notice the tuba player dropped out a while back?
1103,3,23,87,113,1.2566371681415929,0.046662913271925226,547,"I don't know about you, but I've always had a thing for a woman in uniform."
1103,6,17,90,113,1.2566371681415929,0.051492823904971695,547,The good news is we've made it to halftime.
1103,2,25,86,113,1.2566371681415929,0.04493773094102712,547,I wish she was waving a divining rod instead of a baton.
1103,4,21,88,113,1.2566371681415929,0.04832654847926019,547,I didn't know band camp would be like this.
1103,5,19,89,113,1.2566371681415929,0.04993478848271368,547,I believe we're out of step.
1103,5,19,89,113,1.2566371681415929,0.04993478848271368,547,And you were afraid we wouldn't make the team!
1103,2,25,86,113,1.2566371681415929,0.04493773094102712,547,Keep going. It's only halftime.
1103,3,23,87,113,1.2566371681415929,0.046662913271925226,547,"ya know, I still have that song stuck in my head."
1103,9,11,93,113,1.2566371681415929,0.05590701523416926,547,I don't care if she's childish and has never served in a marching band. I just want change.
1103,6,17,90,113,1.2566371681415929,0.051492823904971695,547,'Ya know - I'm starting to get the feeling like maybe they don't want us in the band?'
1103,5,19,89,113,1.2566371681415929,0.04993478848271368,547,Are you sure she said this was the road less traveled?
1103,5,19,89,113,1.2566371681415929,0.04993478848271368,547,"At the next rock, I'll distract her and you grab the baton...but I get the hat."
1103,6,17,90,113,1.2566371681415929,0.051492823904971695,547,What's a Fitbit?
1103,7,15,91,113,1.2566371681415929,0.053005082082791775,547,"I have no idea where we're headed, but it's great to see the leadership vacuum filled."
1103,8,13,92,113,1.2566371681415929,0.054475375533341336,547,Her last gig was at the Mirage in Vegas.
1103,3,23,87,113,1.2566371681415929,0.046662913271925226,547,Does she even know we got a crush on her?
1103,8,13,92,113,1.2566371681415929,0.054475375533341336,547,I'm about to give up on this concept of marching to the beat of a different drummer.
1138,5,20,92,117,1.2564102564102564,0.04879002532739663,547,Best mirage I ever saw
1139,4,21,89,114,1.2543859649122806,0.047953626600184374,547,It's the best mirage so far!
1139,7,15,92,114,1.2543859649122806,0.05258627662693806,547,What's the odds on it being a divining rod?
1139,6,17,91,114,1.2543859649122806,0.05108875702500376,547,You ate the last brownie at half-time.
1139,5,19,90,114,1.2543859649122806,0.049545995794159706,547,I just love a parade.
1139,2,25,87,114,1.2543859649122806,0.044598649238064926,547,I don't care if it's only a mirage. At least we're getting somewhere.
1139,4,21,89,114,1.2543859649122806,0.047953626600184374,547,"Well, at least his deportation officers are good looking."
1139,6,17,91,114,1.2543859649122806,0.05108875702500376,547,This isn't quite the midnight at the oasis I expected!
1139,6,17,91,114,1.2543859649122806,0.05108875702500376,547,Guess who she voted for?
1139,3,23,88,114,1.2543859649122806,0.046306532033665936,547,We should've listened to the camel.
1139,4,21,89,114,1.2543859649122806,0.047953626600184374,547,She’s my kind of gal. She refuses to stop and ask for directions.
1139,4,21,89,114,1.2543859649122806,0.047953626600184374,547,Do you think we'll miss the second half?
1150,7,15,93,115,1.2521739130434784,0.05217391304347825,547,I don't mind saying that there's a little part of me that wishes she would have stopped at the waterhole around six miles back.
1151,4,20,88,112,1.25,0.048297927830185765,547,Should we tell her we should have turned left at the gas station?
1151,7,14,91,112,1.25,0.05305954499725111,547,I TOLD you this POKEMON GO thing IS A DISASTER! Happy now?
1151,6,16,90,112,1.25,0.051521259247422846,547,I hate these Mojave State halftime shows.
1151,4,20,88,112,1.25,0.048297927830185765,547,"These footprints seem freshly made, we can't be far behind her now!"
1151,4,20,88,112,1.25,0.048297927830185765,547,"You're right, your mirage is better than mine."
1151,7,14,91,112,1.25,0.05305954499725111,547,She's great! We already covered 5 miles since she joined us!
1151,6,16,90,112,1.25,0.051521259247422846,547,"""Blow in my ear and I'll follow you anywhere"", I told her. You, too?"
1151,5,18,89,112,1.25,0.04993560847296239,547,"If it's a mirage, then how come we can hear the music?"
1151,6,16,90,112,1.25,0.051521259247422846,547,I replaced her baton with a rainstick. Just watch.
1151,3,22,87,112,1.25,0.04660273245009,547,"Naturally, the Arizona State game is on the road"
1151,8,12,92,112,1.25,0.05455447255899809,547,"Remember, we could be with the clown in the Himalayas"
1151,4,20,88,112,1.25,0.048297927830185765,547,How can she walk in those heels?
1151,9,10,93,112,1.25,0.05600951380850968,547,"I'm telling you, it's bound to rain on her parade eventually."
1151,7,14,91,112,1.25,0.05305954499725111,547,"I said, 'Dessert.'"
1151,9,10,93,112,1.25,0.05600951380850968,547,We waited too long -- it'll be awkward if we tell her what happened to the rest of the band now.
1151,7,14,91,112,1.25,0.05305954499725111,547,Who told you that you could find water with a stick?
1151,5,18,89,112,1.25,0.04993560847296239,547,"Wait, that doesn't look like a divining rod to me!"
1151,5,18,89,112,1.25,0.04993560847296239,547,"To think--a couple weeks ago, I was holding down that BIG Snoopy balloon."
1169,7,14,92,113,1.247787610619469,0.052634412625532395,547,What makes you think a majorette can lead us to the promised land?
1170,6,17,95,118,1.2457627118644068,0.04953271530274072,547,"I beg to differ, but it's left. . . right. . .left."
1170,6,17,95,118,1.2457627118644068,0.04953271530274072,547,The Parade is not well attended this year
1172,3,21,86,110,1.2454545454545454,0.046899469502261974,547,"I don't care what the song says, next time I'm letting the parade pass by."
1172,5,17,88,110,1.2454545454545454,0.050330622710028694,547,Is peeking under her skirt worth it?
1172,3,21,86,110,1.2454545454545454,0.046899469502261974,547,When do we break it to her that I dropped my tuba and you dropped your trombone 27 miles ago?
1172,4,19,87,110,1.2454545454545454,0.04864530718359612,547,She promised to take me to Las Vegas--and you?
1172,7,13,90,110,1.2454545454545454,0.053542347027048694,547,"Something seems...wrong, you know?"
1172,1,25,84,110,1.2454545454545454,0.04319663061869463,547,"Yep, you're dying."
1172,4,19,87,110,1.2454545454545454,0.04864530718359612,547,Takes your mind off of the election.
1172,4,19,87,110,1.2454545454545454,0.04864530718359612,547,Who told you that it would rain on her parade?
1172,5,17,88,110,1.2454545454545454,0.050330622710028694,547,It was either her now or Godot whenever....
1172,5,17,88,110,1.2454545454545454,0.050330622710028694,547,I'm sure glad we made America great again.
1172,5,17,88,110,1.2454545454545454,0.050330622710028694,547,"If we're lucky, it's a divining rod."
1172,4,19,87,110,1.2454545454545454,0.04864530718359612,547,I hid my tuba behind that last rock.
1172,4,19,87,110,1.2454545454545454,0.04864530718359612,547,You have to admire her perseverance.
1172,6,15,89,110,1.2454545454545454,0.05196130535092515,547,She can lead us to water but she can't make us drink.
1172,3,21,86,110,1.2454545454545454,0.046899469502261974,547,"I told her if She went Commando, I'd follow Her anywhere!"
1172,6,15,89,110,1.2454545454545454,0.05196130535092515,547,Either way we're deserters
1172,2,23,85,110,1.2454545454545454,0.045086079539041465,547,This is more fun than I thought it would be.
1172,5,17,88,110,1.2454545454545454,0.050330622710028694,547,Enough already with the 'Oom Pah Pah'.
1172,5,17,88,110,1.2454545454545454,0.050330622710028694,547,"I know its just a mirage, but please don't tell my wife?"

1172,6,15,89,110,1.2454545454545454,0.05196130535092515,547,We're just about out of mirages.
1172,5,17,88,110,1.2454545454545454,0.050330622710028694,547,"On the bright side, she's less annoying than a tiger on a boat."
1172,6,15,89,110,1.2454545454545454,0.05196130535092515,547,I'm starting to think our majorette is more like a mirage-ette.
1172,6,15,89,110,1.2454545454545454,0.05196130535092515,547,When we passed the oasis she just came darting out of the palm trees.
1172,11,5,94,110,1.2454545454545454,0.05944750298150646,547,Maybe we shouldn't have held the straight pride parade on inauguration day.
1172,6,15,89,110,1.2454545454545454,0.05196130535092515,547,Why do I have to crawl on my hands and knees to have my caption picked?
1172,7,13,90,110,1.2454545454545454,0.053542347027048694,547,"She marches to the beat of a different, drier, drummer"

1202,0,26,83,109,1.238532110091743,0.04100977102934036,547,That baton better have a GPS in it!
1202,7,12,90,109,1.238532110091743,0.05358231029949613,547,What’s a pheromone?
1202,6,14,89,109,1.238532110091743,0.05197277471642225,547,Don't you just love a parade?
1202,6,14,89,109,1.238532110091743,0.05197277471642225,547,It's the boots.
1202,3,20,86,109,1.238532110091743,0.046813302765362025,547,"You know, majorettes originated in the Rhineland, where young women performing at carnivals were called ""Tanzmariechen"" or Dance Mary's. Really interesting, huh?"
1202,2,22,85,109,1.238532110091743,0.0449621023807155,547,"Hey, you’re a survivor! When this parade started we were waay at the back."
1202,2,22,85,109,1.238532110091743,0.0449621023807155,547,Let's split after halftime.
1202,3,20,86,109,1.238532110091743,0.046813302765362025,547,"As mirages go, I prefer mine more classical."
1202,4,18,87,109,1.238532110091743,0.048594032361072494,547,Epaulettes are so Seventies.
1202,5,16,88,109,1.238532110091743,0.05031177443120517,547,How do we explain this to our wives?
1202,3,20,86,109,1.238532110091743,0.046813302765362025,547,"Hallucination!? Whatever, I'm motivated."
1202,3,20,86,109,1.238532110091743,0.046813302765362025,547,This is the one time i really wish it would rain on our Parade!
1202,6,14,89,109,1.238532110091743,0.05197277471642225,547,I don't have the heart to tell her that we lost our last piccolo player two mirages ago.
1202,6,14,89,109,1.238532110091743,0.05197277471642225,547,It's her boots ... they are really made for walking.
1202,1,24,84,109,1.238532110091743,0.043031337246086515,547,"I don't care if she is a mirage, this beats just lying around waiting for the inevitable...."
1202,4,18,87,109,1.238532110091743,0.048594032361072494,547,"OK, then ask your hallucination to slow down the pace."
1202,7,12,90,109,1.238532110091743,0.05358231029949613,547,Does she realize halftime was 5 days ago?

1202,7,12,90,109,1.238532110091743,0.05358231029949613,547,Get rid of the tubas you said. We won't need them out here you said.
1202,7,12,90,109,1.238532110091743,0.05358231029949613,547,This really wasn't what I had in mind when she said she'd lead us to the nearest watering hole.
1202,4,18,87,109,1.238532110091743,0.048594032361072494,547,"Oh, yeah? Are the footprints a mirage, too?"
1202,3,20,86,109,1.238532110091743,0.046813302765362025,547,"Well, this parade has gone to hell."
1202,7,12,90,109,1.238532110091743,0.05358231029949613,547,Do YOU see a Macy's out here?
1202,4,18,87,109,1.238532110091743,0.048594032361072494,547,This dry run isn't working.

1202,3,20,86,109,1.238532110091743,0.046813302765362025,547,I hear we are getting the band back together
1202,4,18,87,109,1.238532110091743,0.048594032361072494,547,It's worth it if we get season tickets.
1202,5,16,88,109,1.238532110091743,0.05031177443120517,547,Much better than the lemonade stand hallucination.
1202,4,18,87,109,1.238532110091743,0.048594032361072494,547,Come on. It's better than the island last week.
1202,6,14,89,109,1.238532110091743,0.05197277471642225,547,"Now I can't get ""76 Trombones"" out of my head."
1202,2,22,85,109,1.238532110091743,0.0449621023807155,547,I'm seeing a downside to the Raiders move to Las Vegas
1202,1,24,84,109,1.238532110091743,0.043031337246086515,547,"Sorry. When I said: ""Don't rain on my parade, I really didn't mean it.'"
1202,4,18,87,109,1.238532110091743,0.048594032361072494,547,Choosing a grand marshal with no prior parade experience seemed like such a great idea.
1202,5,16,88,109,1.238532110091743,0.05031177443120517,547,I'm having some major hallucinations.
1202,5,16,88,109,1.238532110091743,0.05031177443120517,547,Everyone's demise should be preceded by a peppy Souza march.
1202,6,14,89,109,1.238532110091743,0.05197277471642225,547,So where are these 76 trombones?
1202,3,20,86,109,1.238532110091743,0.046813302765362025,547,I thought she'd pass the baton by now.
1202,6,14,89,109,1.238532110091743,0.05197277471642225,547,Saying to the ends of the earth was a bit brash.
1202,5,16,88,109,1.238532110091743,0.05031177443120517,547,I think we've shown enough spirit!
1202,6,14,89,109,1.238532110091743,0.05197277471642225,547,Music Man meets Ishtar is NOT a great concept.
1202,4,18,87,109,1.238532110091743,0.048594032361072494,547,It could be worse - we could be in the tuba section.
1202,5,16,88,109,1.238532110091743,0.05031177443120517,547,"Nice mirage, I guess, but my vote's still for an oasis."
1202,6,14,89,109,1.238532110091743,0.05197277471642225,547,She's a female leader I felt I could really get behind.
1202,7,12,90,109,1.238532110091743,0.05358231029949613,547,I didn't want to say anything but I think she lost the beat back there where the buzzards ate the last of the percussion section.
1202,7,12,90,109,1.238532110091743,0.05358231029949613,547,I cant get the Notre Dame fight song out of my head.
1202,4,18,87,109,1.238532110091743,0.048594032361072494,547,Your wife sure is a good sport about this!
1202,4,18,87,109,1.238532110091743,0.048594032361072494,547,I'm beginning to think we should have followed that guy playing the water glasses.
1202,4,18,87,109,1.238532110091743,0.048594032361072494,547,They say it's all about 'the journey'.
1202,4,18,87,109,1.238532110091743,0.048594032361072494,547,She had beans last night.
1202,5,16,88,109,1.238532110091743,0.05031177443120517,547,A fork in which road?
1202,4,18,87,109,1.238532110091743,0.048594032361072494,547,I'm pretty sure we'll make it by half-time.
1202,3,20,86,109,1.238532110091743,0.046813302765362025,547,After 3 days the mirages get better.
1202,3,20,86,109,1.238532110091743,0.046813302765362025,547,"If she weren't a mirage, she'd be marching in a straight line wouldn't she?"
1202,5,16,88,109,1.238532110091743,0.05031177443120517,547,That mirage has great legs
1202,5,16,88,109,1.238532110091743,0.05031177443120517,547,Told you there'd be a Macy's around here some place.
1202,6,14,89,109,1.238532110091743,0.05197277471642225,547,I'm starting to think this isn't the Trump victory parade?
1202,3,20,86,109,1.238532110091743,0.046813302765362025,547,I don't know ... but I sure hope it's a football game!
1202,6,14,89,109,1.238532110091743,0.05197277471642225,547,I wonder if all of this groveling will get us anywhere.
1202,6,14,89,109,1.238532110091743,0.05197277471642225,547,"We are followed by rows and rows of the finest virtuosos, the cream of every famous band."
1202,4,18,87,109,1.238532110091743,0.048594032361072494,547,"I know, I know, but it's just such a catchy beat!"
1202,6,14,89,109,1.238532110091743,0.05197277471642225,547,I guess we're all that's left of the band.
1202,4,18,87,109,1.238532110091743,0.048594032361072494,547,Can we go back to the Kate Upton mirage?
1202,6,14,89,109,1.238532110091743,0.05197277471642225,547,Let's make a deal. I'll stop humming Stars and Stripes Forever if you'll quit imitating a boombox.
1202,6,14,89,109,1.238532110091743,0.05197277471642225,547,She's a lot better looking than that stupid bunny with the battery.
1202,7,12,90,109,1.238532110091743,0.05358231029949613,547,We just passed Boulder.
1202,3,20,86,109,1.238532110091743,0.046813302765362025,547,It's so much easier crawling in rhythm.
1202,4,18,87,109,1.238532110091743,0.048594032361072494,547,Next time I'm flying.
1202,4,18,87,109,1.238532110091743,0.048594032361072494,547,...of course the sousaphone player was the first to go.
1202,4,18,87,109,1.238532110091743,0.048594032361072494,547,"Ok, you do the drums and I'll do the horns."
1202,5,16,88,109,1.238532110091743,0.05031177443120517,547,I suspect that we Americans may be fools.
1202,5,16,88,109,1.238532110091743,0.05031177443120517,547,I'm starting to rethink this whole emigrate to Canada thing.
1202,7,12,90,109,1.238532110091743,0.05358231029949613,547,"She does know how thirsty we are, right ?"
1202,6,14,89,109,1.238532110091743,0.05197277471642225,547,I thought the plain was supposed to be fruited.
1202,5,16,88,109,1.238532110091743,0.05031177443120517,547,We're getting closer—I smell hotdogs.
1202,6,14,89,109,1.238532110091743,0.05197277471642225,547,They're probably just stuck at a red light.
1202,3,20,86,109,1.238532110091743,0.046813302765362025,547,This peyote you found has confusing metaphors
1202,4,18,87,109,1.238532110091743,0.048594032361072494,547,Pretty good as mirages go.
1202,5,16,88,109,1.238532110091743,0.05031177443120517,547,Trust me. Any parade I'm a part of is guaranteed to rain.
1202,5,16,88,109,1.238532110091743,0.05031177443120517,547,How many more miles to burning man again?
1202,7,12,90,109,1.238532110091743,0.05358231029949613,547,"No, I don't love a parade. Do you love a parade?"
1202,4,18,87,109,1.238532110091743,0.048594032361072494,547,Maybe joining the Amelia Earhart Marching Band wasn't such a good idea after all.
1202,4,18,87,109,1.238532110091743,0.048594032361072494,547,He's got to be real. Mirages don't cross-dress.
1202,5,16,88,109,1.238532110091743,0.05031177443120517,547,"No, you've got to lead with your right hand on the downbeat"
1202,2,22,85,109,1.238532110091743,0.0449621023807155,547,Who knew we'd be finalists in the AMAZING RACE!
1202,7,12,90,109,1.238532110091743,0.05358231029949613,547,You are either out of step or you are crawling to the beat of a different drummer.
1202,7,12,90,109,1.238532110091743,0.05358231029949613,547,We can't ask her anything. She's got the talking stick.
1202,5,16,88,109,1.238532110091743,0.05031177443120517,547,I was sure she'd lead us right to Macy's.
1202,8,10,91,109,1.238532110091743,0.05514488772623441,547,Where are the 76 trombones she promised?
1202,4,18,87,109,1.238532110091743,0.048594032361072494,547,I guess following her blindly into oblivion wasn't such a great idea.
1202,6,14,89,109,1.238532110091743,0.05197277471642225,547,Ends of the earth? Wasn't that where we started?
1202,3,20,86,109,1.238532110091743,0.046813302765362025,547,this mirage is even better than the palm trees!
1202,5,16,88,109,1.238532110091743,0.05031177443120517,547,I'm beginning to regret signing up for the Marching Band.
1202,4,18,87,109,1.238532110091743,0.048594032361072494,547,"Hear me out: There's no Dorothy, no Toto, no yellow bricks... I think we're in the wrong gig."
1202,5,16,88,109,1.238532110091743,0.05031177443120517,547,"What kind of a band camp is this, Jerry?"

1373,6,12,88,106,1.2264150943396226,0.05240491130788026,547,Mirage?. I thought I was in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
1373,5,14,87,106,1.2264150943396226,0.05066142723877443,547,I'd prefer marching to my own drummer.
1373,3,18,85,106,1.2264150943396226,0.046980753199957474,547,"Gosh, I love a parade."

1373,3,18,85,106,1.2264150943396226,0.046980753199957474,547,"So we clapped at Hamilton.Was that so bad?"""
1373,3,18,85,106,1.2264150943396226,0.046980753199957474,547,"Water would be better, but the rhythm is nice."
1373,3,18,85,106,1.2264150943396226,0.046980753199957474,547,"She certainly has brightened up this death march, don't you think?"
1373,5,14,87,106,1.2264150943396226,0.05066142723877443,547,Aren't you glad I got us bumped up to first class?

1373,5,14,87,106,1.2264150943396226,0.05066142723877443,547,I'm hoping someone will rain on his parade.
1373,6,12,88,106,1.2264150943396226,0.05240491130788026,547,"So, what's your fetish?"
1373,3,18,85,106,1.2264150943396226,0.046980753199957474,547,"Plus, we don't have to lug an instrument around."

1373,4,16,86,106,1.2264150943396226,0.048855764148690535,547,I told you I would follow her anywhere.
1373,5,14,87,106,1.2264150943396226,0.05066142723877443,547,I'm with her!
1373,3,18,85,106,1.2264150943396226,0.046980753199957474,547,He said she didn't have the stamina to lead.
1373,4,16,86,106,1.2264150943396226,0.048855764148690535,547,"I know it's a death march, but aren't you curious if she drops the baton at the end?"
1373,4,16,86,106,1.2264150943396226,0.048855764148690535,547,I just assumed the flashy costume and air of confidence meant we were going somewhere good?
1373,3,18,85,106,1.2264150943396226,0.046980753199957474,547,"To be honest, I'd have preferred a Busby Berkeley hallucination."

1373,4,16,86,106,1.2264150943396226,0.048855764148690535,547,"They were right. It IS a long, long way to Tipperary."
1373,3,18,85,106,1.2264150943396226,0.046980753199957474,547,She won't be happy till our arms are in synch
1373,3,18,85,106,1.2264150943396226,0.046980753199957474,547,The show must go on.
1373,5,14,87,106,1.2264150943396226,0.05066142723877443,547,Survival of the flutist.
1373,3,18,85,106,1.2264150943396226,0.046980753199957474,547,Everybody loves a parade.
1373,3,18,85,106,1.2264150943396226,0.046980753199957474,547,Halftimes have gotten totally out of control.
1373,4,16,86,106,1.2264150943396226,0.048855764148690535,547,I think we passed Macy's a few mirages ago.
1373,6,12,88,106,1.2264150943396226,0.05240491130788026,547,Maybe we shouldn't have followed Hillary!
1373,4,16,86,106,1.2264150943396226,0.048855764148690535,547,I think it's working. Looks like it may rain on our parade.
1373,3,18,85,106,1.2264150943396226,0.046980753199957474,547,You really have to appreciate her enthusiasm.
1373,1,22,83,106,1.2264150943396226,0.042986069052670925,547,Confidence - it's everything.
1373,6,12,88,106,1.2264150943396226,0.05240491130788026,547,"You're a star, grab her like the Donald to make sure she's real!"
1373,3,18,85,106,1.2264150943396226,0.046980753199957474,547,Best mirage ever!
1373,3,18,85,106,1.2264150943396226,0.046980753199957474,547,"I know, but I like the view from here..."
1373,8,8,90,106,1.2264150943396226,0.05572848255444534,547,So much for following a different drummer.
1373,4,16,86,106,1.2264150943396226,0.048855764148690535,547,I don't care if it IS a mirage. I love a parade.
1373,5,14,87,106,1.2264150943396226,0.05066142723877443,547,"I'm feeling it, I tell you. She's leading us to the promised land."
1373,6,12,88,106,1.2264150943396226,0.05240491130788026,547,"I'm tellin' ya, the longer we wait the funnier the look on her face will be."
1373,3,18,85,106,1.2264150943396226,0.046980753199957474,547,"this is going nowhere, let's eat her !"
1373,3,18,85,106,1.2264150943396226,0.046980753199957474,547,You're sure this is homecoming weekend?
1373,2,20,84,106,1.2264150943396226,0.045027732031695245,547,"Mirage or not, it gives hope."
1373,5,14,87,106,1.2264150943396226,0.05066142723877443,547,"Trouble!"" ""Oh, we got trouble!!"" ""Right here in River City!"" ""Right here in River City!!"" ""With a capital ""T"" and that rhymes with ""P"" and that stands for..."
1373,4,16,86,106,1.2264150943396226,0.048855764148690535,547,I told you we should have followed that turkey balloon instead of her.
1373,3,18,85,106,1.2264150943396226,0.046980753199957474,547,Things could be worse. Our mirage could have come with four legs.
1373,5,14,87,106,1.2264150943396226,0.05066142723877443,547,"Even though I'm technically the section lead, I want you to know I consider us equal partners on the team."
1373,5,14,87,106,1.2264150943396226,0.05066142723877443,547,That promise to make us great again sounded good at the time.
1373,5,14,87,106,1.2264150943396226,0.05066142723877443,547,Drum mirage-ette?
1460,5,14,88,107,1.2242990654205608,0.05023031282392356,547,It must be halftime.
1460,6,12,89,107,1.2242990654205608,0.05195594354493409,547,"I never took you seriously that if TRUMP won, we would march to Mexico."
1460,5,14,88,107,1.2242990654205608,0.05023031282392356,547,I miss the trumpets.
1460,5,14,88,107,1.2242990654205608,0.05023031282392356,547,Maybe this is why she got drummed out of town.
1460,2,20,85,107,1.2242990654205608,0.044655090377511794,547,I think its time we switch parties...
1460,5,14,88,107,1.2242990654205608,0.05023031282392356,547,"I'm an optimist, Tom. I say the desert is half full."
1460,3,18,86,107,1.2242990654205608,0.046587689789030155,547,Don't give up. I'm pretty sure it's going to be great again real soon...
1460,5,14,88,107,1.2242990654205608,0.05023031282392356,547,Percussion deserted us.
1468,4,15,84,103,1.2233009708737863,0.049616919769214105,547,"Sure, I'm thirsty, but who cares?"
1469,4,16,88,108,1.2222222222222223,0.048037522351901875,547,Stamina is highly overrated.
1469,2,20,86,108,1.2222222222222223,0.04428840729415601,547,You may see a lake but I have a different need

1472,3,17,84,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04724827321830709,547,At least we wont die of boredom.
1472,4,15,85,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04918440626354967,547,I call it the Trail of Cheers.
1472,2,19,83,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04522933588640989,547,Marching to a different drummer has its drawbacks.
1472,2,19,83,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04522933588640989,547,Anyway her enthusiasm is inspirational
1472,4,15,85,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04918440626354967,547,I-i-i-i love a parade!...
1472,6,11,87,104,1.2211538461538463,0.05284428837887896,547,That's the last time I bet on an election.
1472,5,13,86,104,1.2211538461538463,0.051047157774787154,547,This is nothing to where The Donald will lead us.
1472,2,19,83,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04522933588640989,547,Are you sure she knows the way to the oasis?
1472,4,15,85,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04918440626354967,547,What if she's a mirage leading us to a mirage?
1472,3,17,84,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04724827321830709,547,Isn't this more fun than using the GPS device to get to Pasdena??
1472,2,19,83,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04522933588640989,547,We do a dry run before the parade.
1472,4,15,85,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04918440626354967,547,"If a majorette comes, can beer be far behind?"
1472,2,19,83,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04522933588640989,547,The tubas fell back about a mile ago.
1472,6,11,87,104,1.2211538461538463,0.05284428837887896,547,It kills me that I forgot my tuba.
1472,7,9,88,104,1.2211538461538463,0.05458228019839617,547,She won't stop until the band is back together.
1472,3,17,84,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04724827321830709,547,I wish she'd let us twirl the baton once in a while.
1472,6,11,87,104,1.2211538461538463,0.05284428837887896,547,This parade is making me thirsty.
1472,2,19,83,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04522933588640989,547,"If we're going to follow her, can't you at least crawl at the right rhythm?"
1472,3,17,84,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04724827321830709,547,I thought her enthusiasm was supposed to be infectious.
1472,5,13,86,104,1.2211538461538463,0.051047157774787154,547,"It's okay, we are with the band."
1472,2,19,83,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04522933588640989,547,"I love a parade, Don't you?"
1472,5,13,86,104,1.2211538461538463,0.051047157774787154,547,"If we'd have followed those damn' trombones, we'd be in River City by now"
1472,6,11,87,104,1.2211538461538463,0.05284428837887896,547,Since when did Moses wear high heels and a skirt?
1472,2,19,83,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04522933588640989,547,Somehow this doesn't seem as delusional as pleading with the rock.
1472,0,23,81,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04089351818997074,547,Death Valley needed a bit of animation to attract tourists.
1472,5,13,86,104,1.2211538461538463,0.051047157774787154,547,Maybe we shouldn't have signed up to be Trumpettes?
1472,4,15,85,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04918440626354967,547,Are you SURE this is the way to the promised land?...cause I am really thirsty
1472,5,13,86,104,1.2211538461538463,0.051047157774787154,547,My wife suffers from water retention.
1472,5,13,86,104,1.2211538461538463,0.051047157774787154,547,NOW she shows up!
1472,4,15,85,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04918440626354967,547,"""I followed because I love a parade! What's your excuse?"
1472,5,13,86,104,1.2211538461538463,0.051047157774787154,547,I'm beginning to think she's a little off key.
1472,4,15,85,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04918440626354967,547,I like your mirage more than mine.
1472,3,17,84,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04724827321830709,547,"I think we've carried this ""marching to a different drummer"" thing too far."
1472,2,19,83,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04522933588640989,547,We follow her to the sideline and then it's Gatorade!
1472,4,15,85,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04918440626354967,547,"Yes, I'm still with her."
1472,5,13,86,104,1.2211538461538463,0.051047157774787154,547,And the band crawled on.
1472,5,13,86,104,1.2211538461538463,0.051047157774787154,547,Someone should rain on this parade asap.
1472,5,13,86,104,1.2211538461538463,0.051047157774787154,547,I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
1472,3,17,84,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04724827321830709,547,I sure hope this turns out to be a good idea.
1472,2,19,83,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04522933588640989,547,It's not the best view... but at least we get to see a parade.
1472,3,17,84,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04724827321830709,547,"More like marching SAND, am I right??"
1472,5,13,86,104,1.2211538461538463,0.051047157774787154,547,"She might be a mirage, but she knows where she's going."
1472,5,13,86,104,1.2211538461538463,0.051047157774787154,547,Ain't been so bad since the tuba player dropped.
1472,7,9,88,104,1.2211538461538463,0.05458228019839617,547,If you knew Sousa ........
1472,2,19,83,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04522933588640989,547,This is going to be great.
1472,5,13,86,104,1.2211538461538463,0.051047157774787154,547,When do we start feeling great again?
1472,3,17,84,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04724827321830709,547,she seems to know where we`re going
1472,5,13,86,104,1.2211538461538463,0.051047157774787154,547,"Because sooner or later, it'll rain on a parade."
1472,2,19,83,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04522933588640989,547,"Of all the drum majorettes in the world, we fall in love with the Energizer Bunny!"
1472,4,15,85,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04918440626354967,547,"Maybe we were told""fall behind"" , not ""crawl behind""."
1472,2,19,83,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04522933588640989,547,"Hey, at least we got Team Spirit!"
1472,2,19,83,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04522933588640989,547,I'm having second thoughts about this parade route.
1472,4,15,85,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04918440626354967,547,I call this the homecoming mirage.
1472,4,15,85,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04918440626354967,547,"I vowed, 'To honor and obey.' What's your excuse?"
1472,6,11,87,104,1.2211538461538463,0.05284428837887896,547,"I followed Trump in '16 and, ironically, it turned out a lot like this, too."
1472,3,17,84,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04724827321830709,547,Bark one more time and I'll kill you.
1472,3,17,84,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04724827321830709,547,I'm still praying for when the saints go marching in.
1472,2,19,83,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04522933588640989,547,"Sure she has a cute rear end, but this is getting ridiculous."
1472,5,13,86,104,1.2211538461538463,0.051047157774787154,547,Does she know that we want it to rain on her parade?
1472,2,19,83,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04522933588640989,547,I feel bad for dropping my tuba.
1472,3,17,84,104,1.2211538461538463,0.04724827321830709,547,These halftime shows are getting longer and longer.
1533,5,14,90,109,1.2201834862385321,0.04938940487411066,547,Maybe the water boy will be along next.
1533,5,14,90,109,1.2201834862385321,0.04938940487411066,547,Im starting to think there may not be a Santa float.
1533,1,22,86,109,1.2201834862385321,0.041949191322226805,547,Maybe next time we should follow the band
1536,2,18,80,100,1.22,0.046231739501923746,547,Now you sing - oh when the saints. It's not that difficult.
1536,2,18,80,100,1.22,0.046231739501923746,547,My commitment to follow her anywhere is wearing thin.
1536,3,16,81,100,1.22,0.048367281703584904,547,I think I'm starting to hallucinate...it looks like there's a man crawling right next to me!
1539,3,17,85,105,1.2190476190476192,0.04684350139437753,547,At this point I would score eight for Style and two for Direction.
1539,4,15,86,105,1.2190476190476192,0.04875924328817289,547,"You know, this mirage is much better than the water mirage that we saw fifty miles ago."
1539,6,11,88,105,1.2190476190476192,0.05238095238095237,547,What's not to love?
1539,3,17,85,105,1.2190476190476192,0.04684350139437753,547,Maybe we were marching to the beat of the wrong different drummer.
1539,4,15,86,105,1.2190476190476192,0.04875924328817289,547,You're the one who said we should march to a different drummer; big mistake!
1539,2,19,84,105,1.2190476190476192,0.04484599691984634,547,I could think of worst mirages.
1545,2,18,81,101,1.2178217821782178,0.04582351075408372,547,Wasn’t there a Snoopy float last year?
1546,2,19,85,106,1.2169811320754718,0.04446894790914134,547,You think you're tired. I've been in this band for five years!
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,We crawl to the beat of a different drum majorette.
1547,7,8,88,103,1.2135922330097086,0.054583352441672076,547,I thought you told me he was going to make America great again!
1547,2,18,83,103,1.2135922330097086,0.045027828265129306,547,"No, really, she's better than a GPS."
1547,3,16,84,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0470942961235598,547,We need to keep following her. She's the drum major for the Niagara Falls High School band.
1547,6,10,87,103,1.2135922330097086,0.05281074658317402,547,"Gosh, I love a parade."
1547,5,12,86,103,1.2135922330097086,0.05097653916825528,547,When I said I'd follow her to the ends of the earth I didn't mean with her ex husband.
1547,5,12,86,103,1.2135922330097086,0.05097653916825528,547,"all in all, i say she's the best mirage we've seen yet."
1547,5,12,86,103,1.2135922330097086,0.05097653916825528,547,The leader of the sand
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,"Lucky for you I have ""Fall off your Float"" Road Service!"
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,It's my mirage and I'll say Drum Majorette if I want...
1547,2,18,83,103,1.2135922330097086,0.045027828265129306,547,Do you think she has noticed us yet ?
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,This is the only way to sneak into Canada.
1547,3,16,84,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0470942961235598,547,"You're dragging behind the beat, Ken."
1547,2,18,83,103,1.2135922330097086,0.045027828265129306,547,You're right. It is just like high school.
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,"Jeez, can't she do anything slower than 2/2 time?"
1547,2,18,83,103,1.2135922330097086,0.045027828265129306,547,Halftime seems like a lifetime ago.
1547,5,12,86,103,1.2135922330097086,0.05097653916825528,547,"I don't know, I dialed 911 and this is what they sent"
1547,2,18,83,103,1.2135922330097086,0.045027828265129306,547,Are we getting close to Pasadena yet?
1547,6,10,87,103,1.2135922330097086,0.05281074658317402,547,"Except for the knobby knees, this mirage gets a 10."
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,Makes more sense than the Tabasco truck you had us follow.
1547,2,18,83,103,1.2135922330097086,0.045027828265129306,547,"What part of ""follow me"" did we misunderstand?"
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,"The lake was a bust, but no complaints about this mirage."
1547,2,18,83,103,1.2135922330097086,0.045027828265129306,547,How long is this halftime show?
1547,2,18,83,103,1.2135922330097086,0.045027828265129306,547,Too bad there's only one more mile to go.
1547,5,12,86,103,1.2135922330097086,0.05097653916825528,547,It's the different drummer.
1547,6,10,87,103,1.2135922330097086,0.05281074658317402,547,She's making the desert great again.
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,Geez. By now I'd thought I'd be more thirsty than horny.
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,"One time, at band camp..."
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,Do you think we can talk her into using that stick as a dowsing rod
1547,2,18,83,103,1.2135922330097086,0.045027828265129306,547,Where did we lose the band?
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,I don't care what gender it is as long as it leads us to water.
1547,2,18,83,103,1.2135922330097086,0.045027828265129306,547,"Nice, but now pretend you're the Grand Marshal and we have a convertible to ride in."
1547,7,8,88,103,1.2135922330097086,0.054583352441672076,547,I think her candidacy led us astray
1547,3,16,84,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0470942961235598,547,I lost my glockenspiel.
1547,3,16,84,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0470942961235598,547,Mirage? I thought you were following your instincts.
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,"She blew in my ear, and you?"
1547,3,16,84,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0470942961235598,547,"I guess we're already dead, but who cares?"
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,"Bob, let's not ever - EVER - audition for a crummy community production of 'Music Man' again!"
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,"I'm really tired of your humming, "" When the Saints Go Marching On""."
1547,3,16,84,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0470942961235598,547,Do you think she'll notice we're out of step?
1547,3,16,84,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0470942961235598,547,"I say we give her two more dunes, max."
1547,5,12,86,103,1.2135922330097086,0.05097653916825528,547,I really wish we had followed a different drum majorette.
1547,6,10,87,103,1.2135922330097086,0.05281074658317402,547,That baton looked a lot like a water divining rod......
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,Because it's shiny!
1547,6,10,87,103,1.2135922330097086,0.05281074658317402,547,But would she follow you anywhere?
1547,3,16,84,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0470942961235598,547,I can't keep in step anymore
1547,3,16,84,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0470942961235598,547,"If you start singing ""I Love a Parade"" one more time, I will strangle you."
1547,3,16,84,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0470942961235598,547,I hope the halftime show is worth it.
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,"You're the one who fell for the ""I'm a direct descendant of Moses"" line."
1547,3,16,84,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0470942961235598,547,"Yeah? Well, I think she's a LOUSY water diviner."
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,We seemed to have lost the rest of the band
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,Halftime is almost over.
1547,2,18,83,103,1.2135922330097086,0.045027828265129306,547,This is the first parade in my honor.
1547,3,16,84,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0470942961235598,547,Because Moses didn't have a baton.
1547,1,20,82,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0428618467774595,547,"When you said you'd follow her anywhere, did you have any idea?"
1547,3,16,84,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0470942961235598,547,She gave the signal for Allegro. Quicken the pace.
1547,3,16,84,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0470942961235598,547,"Me? I started in high school, and I think I'll be at first base with her soon."
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,The show must go on.
1547,3,16,84,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0470942961235598,547,I am starting to think she was over-confident.
1547,3,16,84,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0470942961235598,547,Who loves a parade more than us?
1547,7,8,88,103,1.2135922330097086,0.054583352441672076,547,"Since Palin '08, I find boots irresistible. What's your excuse."
1547,3,16,84,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0470942961235598,547,The view is definitely better from here.
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,I meant follow him on Twitter....
1547,6,10,87,103,1.2135922330097086,0.05281074658317402,547,"Are you sure the genie didn't think you asked for a leader, as opposed to a liter?"
1547,3,16,84,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0470942961235598,547,I-I-I-I-I -- love a parade!
1547,3,16,84,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0470942961235598,547,"I'm just saying that if it's a mirage, it's at least an inspiring one."
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,"Everybody loves a parade, but not as much as we do, right?"
1547,5,12,86,103,1.2135922330097086,0.05097653916825528,547,I'm worried that our fearless leader has no idea where we're going.
1547,3,16,84,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0470942961235598,547,I didn't think the Dust Bowl parade would be so long.
1547,6,10,87,103,1.2135922330097086,0.05281074658317402,547,"Hey, at least we are going out in style."
1547,6,10,87,103,1.2135922330097086,0.05281074658317402,547,We have to stand up. She started singing the Star Spangled Banner.
1547,3,16,84,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0470942961235598,547,Rain prance.
1547,3,16,84,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0470942961235598,547,I was relieved someone else shares this fetish
1547,5,12,86,103,1.2135922330097086,0.05097653916825528,547,Doreen is a natural leader. She just has to improve her situational awareness.
1547,2,18,83,103,1.2135922330097086,0.045027828265129306,547,We've gotta stay upbeat.
1547,2,18,83,103,1.2135922330097086,0.045027828265129306,547,I used to love a parade but those days are long gone.
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,Nice ass
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,Who got her a Fitbit?
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,Who cares if she's lying about the waterfall and the oasis - she's a great leader.
1547,7,8,88,103,1.2135922330097086,0.054583352441672076,547,It's not easy being a Hillary cheerleader.
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,I warned you that she marched to the beat of a distant drummer!
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,She promised to get us there by opening kickoff!!!
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,So where the hell are those seventy-six trombones?
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,And you had to go and mouth off about her lack of stamina!
1547,5,12,86,103,1.2135922330097086,0.05097653916825528,547,I'm first trumpet now!
1547,3,16,84,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0470942961235598,547,Do you think that the mirages are getting crazier?
1547,5,12,86,103,1.2135922330097086,0.05097653916825528,547,Did you say drum or dumb?
1547,2,18,83,103,1.2135922330097086,0.045027828265129306,547,Whaddaya mean you don't love a parade?
1547,5,12,86,103,1.2135922330097086,0.05097653916825528,547,If you think this is good just wait til the halftime show!
1547,5,12,86,103,1.2135922330097086,0.05097653916825528,547,It's left/right in unison.
1547,5,12,86,103,1.2135922330097086,0.05097653916825528,547,"We are on our way to Macy's, right?"
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,My agent said think Lawrence of Arabia.
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,Can you believe she got cut from cross country?
1547,5,12,86,103,1.2135922330097086,0.05097653916825528,547,When we reach the stadium it's beer and hotdogs.
1547,3,16,84,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0470942961235598,547,She can lead us to water but she can't make us drink.
1547,3,16,84,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0470942961235598,547,Looks like it's only halftime.
1547,3,16,84,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0470942961235598,547,"Technically to be considered a parade, we'd have to be marching, too."
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,She works at The Mirage.
1547,7,8,88,103,1.2135922330097086,0.054583352441672076,547,She makes me feel guilty for putting down my tuba.
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,See! I told you she is wearing panties.

1547,3,16,84,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0470942961235598,547,When do we get to see Santa?
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,I think we went to high school together.
1547,5,12,86,103,1.2135922330097086,0.05097653916825528,547,I never heard 'Midnight at the Oasis' in a marching band style before.
1547,2,18,83,103,1.2135922330097086,0.045027828265129306,547,"Yessir, I'd go to the ends of the earth for her."
1547,3,16,84,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0470942961235598,547,The rest of the band deserted her miles ago.
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,Think this is what it’s like following a populist demagogue?
1547,5,12,86,103,1.2135922330097086,0.05097653916825528,547,Her band has deserted her
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,This better end in something better than just a mirage.
1547,3,16,84,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0470942961235598,547,"So, you steal the baton--how does that help us?"
1547,2,18,83,103,1.2135922330097086,0.045027828265129306,547,And you said Fantasy Cheerleader Camp would be so fun.
1547,4,14,85,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0490738233325375,547,Stop talking or we'll never get a water break.
1547,3,16,84,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0470942961235598,547,We should have followed the tuba player!
1547,5,12,86,103,1.2135922330097086,0.05097653916825528,547,We should have brought a GPS instead!
1547,3,16,84,103,1.2135922330097086,0.0470942961235598,547,Just this once. What if it DID rain?
1547,0,22,81,103,1.2135922330097086,0.04058042015646035,547,At least we don't have to worry about stadium parking.
1547,5,12,86,103,1.2135922330097086,0.05097653916825528,547,I see why Barbells with Betsy was 80 percent off on Groupon.
1547,7,8,88,103,1.2135922330097086,0.054583352441672076,547,I told you to pick the camel instead!
1665,4,14,86,104,1.2115384615384615,0.04864304475885961,547,I think your wife is mocking us.
1665,3,16,85,104,1.2115384615384615,0.046684465360827584,547,Tune in for next season's Survivor: Extreme Band Camp
1665,5,12,87,104,1.2115384615384615,0.05052575878498539,547,I'm marching to a different drummer.
1665,5,12,87,104,1.2115384615384615,0.05052575878498539,547,We should have followed the elephants.
1665,3,16,85,104,1.2115384615384615,0.046684465360827584,547,I still see a pool of water. You?
1670,5,11,85,101,1.2079207920792079,0.05135169298966313,547,Next time I'll be more specific when asking a genie for March Madness tickets.
1670,4,13,84,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04938599569639575,547,"If this is a mirage, it's a doozy."
1670,6,9,86,101,1.2079207920792079,0.05324486993959902,547,"Mac, if life is about chasing a dream, then we deserve that drink."
1670,5,11,85,101,1.2079207920792079,0.05135169298966313,547,I'm going to miss Obama's immigration policies.
1670,5,11,85,101,1.2079207920792079,0.05135169298966313,547,She says her last gig was shepherding a cadre of lemmings.
1670,4,13,84,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04938599569639575,547,Do you think she has a boyfriend?
1670,3,15,83,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04733874490250266,547,I think her last name is Pelosi.
1670,5,11,85,101,1.2079207920792079,0.05135169298966313,547,I can't imagine where this is all leading to.
1670,3,15,83,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04733874490250266,547,This seemed like a good idea at first.
1670,3,15,83,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04733874490250266,547,It must be her pheromones.
1670,4,13,84,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04938599569639575,547,''This is going to get old.''
1670,5,11,85,101,1.2079207920792079,0.05135169298966313,547,I'll stand up when she sings the national anthem.
1670,5,11,85,101,1.2079207920792079,0.05135169298966313,547,We should've had a safe word.
1670,4,13,84,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04938599569639575,547,She's always marched to a different drummer.
1670,3,15,83,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04733874490250266,547,The marching band takes hazing a little too far
1670,6,9,86,101,1.2079207920792079,0.05324486993959902,547,Your not going to believe this
1670,2,17,82,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04519886023965674,547,"OK, go back and follow that rock if you'd rather."
1670,5,11,85,101,1.2079207920792079,0.05135169298966313,547,"If this were a metaphor, wouldn't we be being led astray rather by a Trump-eter?"
1670,2,17,82,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04519886023965674,547,"Hey, what happened to the band?"
1670,3,15,83,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04733874490250266,547,"Sure, we're dying of thirst... But what a way to go!"
1670,2,17,82,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04519886023965674,547,I thought you were the different drummer.
1670,4,13,84,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04938599569639575,547,"As mirages go, this one leads the band!"
1670,5,11,85,101,1.2079207920792079,0.05135169298966313,547,Maybe we'll find those 76 trombones.
1670,4,13,84,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04938599569639575,547,They don't make mirages like they used to.
1670,3,15,83,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04733874490250266,547,You'd think she would have noticed when the band stopped playing.
1670,5,11,85,101,1.2079207920792079,0.05135169298966313,547,Does she know she veered off the parade route?
1670,2,17,82,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04519886023965674,547,You have a better idea?
1670,5,11,85,101,1.2079207920792079,0.05135169298966313,547,"Once in a while, I think I see a flash of panties!"
1670,5,11,85,101,1.2079207920792079,0.05135169298966313,547,I never saw myself as a follower before today
1670,3,15,83,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04733874490250266,547,"With this kind of leadership, it's the journey, not the destination, that matters"
1670,2,17,82,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04519886023965674,547,We said we’d follow her anywhere.
1670,2,17,82,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04519886023965674,547,It looks like we made it to halftime.
1670,0,21,80,101,1.2079207920792079,0.040581983231523164,547,So your line in the sand is if she asked you to jump off a bridge?
1670,4,13,84,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04938599569639575,547,These NCAA sanctions are really getting ridiculous.
1670,3,15,83,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04733874490250266,547,"To me, she sure looks like one long drink of water."
1670,2,17,82,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04519886023965674,547,"I told you, her legs take you places"
1670,4,13,84,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04938599569639575,547,Did she say she was a drum major or a drum mirage?
1670,5,11,85,101,1.2079207920792079,0.05135169298966313,547,"Hey, get in step!"
1670,3,15,83,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04733874490250266,547,I'm beginning to think she's a mirage.
1670,5,11,85,101,1.2079207920792079,0.05135169298966313,547,"We've come this far, we can't desert her now."
1670,5,11,85,101,1.2079207920792079,0.05135169298966313,547,"Drum Major or Drum Mirage, she got us this far..."
1670,2,17,82,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04519886023965674,547,"Just between us guys, the accommodations suck but the view is outstanding."
1670,3,15,83,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04733874490250266,547,We just have to hang on a little longer. I was told it leads to an orange bowl.
1670,4,13,84,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04938599569639575,547,I don't think we're going to find your contact.
1670,4,13,84,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04938599569639575,547,"I really don't care if she is a he, it is the only thing keeping me going."
1670,7,7,87,101,1.2079207920792079,0.05507300588187477,547,"You know, she's beginning to look like Major-eat."
1670,4,13,84,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04938599569639575,547,And 40 years ago there were 76 Trombones.
1670,6,9,86,101,1.2079207920792079,0.05324486993959902,547,Did she say 76 trombones or 76 miles?
1670,4,13,84,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04938599569639575,547,Why are we following her again?
1670,4,13,84,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04938599569639575,547,I'm just grateful the mirage tuba fell off me a few miles ago.
1670,5,11,85,101,1.2079207920792079,0.05135169298966313,547,Why? I'm a leg man.
1670,4,13,84,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04938599569639575,547,"Now this is a long, strange trip."
1670,3,15,83,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04733874490250266,547,Maybe we should have tried out for the football team instead?
1670,4,13,84,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04938599569639575,547,She must do crossfit.
1670,2,17,82,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04519886023965674,547,It's possible I have been too quick to dismiss the importance of school spirit.
1670,4,13,84,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04938599569639575,547,Thank God SHE knows where we're going.
1670,2,17,82,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04519886023965674,547,At least we won't have to stop and ask for directions.
1670,4,13,84,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04938599569639575,547,I wish someone would rain on this parade already.

1670,4,13,84,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04938599569639575,547,It's never going to rain on this parade.
1670,1,19,81,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04295249893759181,547,Are you sure this guy is Bedouin?
1670,5,11,85,101,1.2079207920792079,0.05135169298966313,547,You've got to admit her leadership qualities really are second to none.
1670,5,11,85,101,1.2079207920792079,0.05135169298966313,547,"If you can't get the timing right, you are going to get the baton, again. Keep up."

1670,3,15,83,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04733874490250266,547,"Yes, I've seen ""Animal House."" Why?"
1670,3,15,83,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04733874490250266,547,Are you sure she's a dominatrix?
1670,4,13,84,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04938599569639575,547,This is the strictest band I've ever been in.
1670,1,19,81,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04295249893759181,547,I've always loved a parade
1670,3,15,83,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04733874490250266,547,"Carl, you seriously need to upgrade your GPS service."
1670,2,17,82,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04519886023965674,547,We're certainly marching to a different drummer
1670,3,15,83,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04733874490250266,547,I hear it's down to me and one other guy to replace her
1670,4,13,84,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04938599569639575,547,What did we exactly sign up for...?
1670,3,15,83,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04733874490250266,547,"She did say Simon Says, didn't she?"
1670,4,13,84,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04938599569639575,547,Should we tell her that we already passed our house?
1670,4,13,84,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04938599569639575,547,"Don't complain, she got us great seats on the 50 yard line."
1670,4,13,84,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04938599569639575,547,I'm starting to think there is no water.
1670,4,13,84,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04938599569639575,547,for our next group vision let's have a pastry chief
1670,6,9,86,101,1.2079207920792079,0.05324486993959902,547,They really drag out the half-time show for commercials.
1670,5,11,85,101,1.2079207920792079,0.05135169298966313,547,Wasn't the parade supposed to end at Sepulveda?
1670,4,13,84,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04938599569639575,547,Hey ! I think I can see Macy's !
1670,2,17,82,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04519886023965674,547,Much better than that cliche' oasis mirage.
1670,3,15,83,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04733874490250266,547,What happened to the crowds?
1670,4,13,84,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04938599569639575,547,I hear she's married to a tall drink of water
1670,5,11,85,101,1.2079207920792079,0.05135169298966313,547,There's just something about the way she moves.
1670,1,19,81,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04295249893759181,547,"If we start hearing music, we're goners."
1670,5,11,85,101,1.2079207920792079,0.05135169298966313,547,Hope it rains on this parade!
1670,4,13,84,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04938599569639575,547,She comes with alumni parking.
1670,4,13,84,101,1.2079207920792079,0.04938599569639575,547,"Faster, men and rats. The pestilence is almost upon us. The America that's Great Again is just over this cliff. Trust me !"
1758,4,13,85,102,1.2058823529411764,0.04894189141242656,547,I've run out of Sousa marches to whistle. How else can we keep going?
1758,3,15,84,102,1.2058823529411764,0.046916646025273935,547,"Yep, Trump says follow her... greatness is up ahead."
1758,4,13,85,102,1.2058823529411764,0.04894189141242656,547,She lied about stopping in Pasadena.
1761,2,16,81,99,1.202020202020202,0.045357095658013595,547,This marching band try-out is brutal.
1761,3,14,82,99,1.202020202020202,0.04757530020731468,547,I ate my tuba an hour ago.
1763,3,14,83,100,1.2,0.04714045207910317,547,Of course she's nuts. But she does have an aura of certainty I find very appealing in these uncertain times.
1763,3,14,83,100,1.2,0.04714045207910317,547,I'm beginning to have my doubts that she is a water dowser.
1763,3,14,83,100,1.2,0.04714045207910317,547,I'd settle for 75 trombones.
1763,3,14,83,100,1.2,0.04714045207910317,547,It seemed like a good idea at the time.
1763,4,12,84,100,1.2,0.04923659639173309,547,Follow the optomistic one you said
1763,2,16,82,100,1.2,0.044946657497549475,547,These better be some awesome seats.
1763,2,16,82,100,1.2,0.044946657497549475,547,"Well, God bless America!"
1763,3,14,83,100,1.2,0.04714045207910317,547,She has a lousy sense of direction.
1763,6,8,86,100,1.2,0.05318160234783104,547,She either has superb balance--or her battery's run out.
1763,2,16,82,100,1.2,0.044946657497549475,547,It's got to rain on our parade soon.
1763,4,12,84,100,1.2,0.04923659639173309,547,"Did she blow in your ear, too?"
1763,5,10,85,100,1.2,0.05124707431905383,547,"Sometimes, I really wonder if she knows where she's going."
1763,2,16,82,100,1.2,0.044946657497549475,547,No peeking if she drops the baton
1763,4,12,84,100,1.2,0.04923659639173309,547,"The practices are grueling, but the refreshments at the end are great."
1763,6,8,86,100,1.2,0.05318160234783104,547,"Good girl, Lassie, good girl!! (Didn't she have four legs this morning?)"
1763,1,18,81,100,1.2,0.04264014327112209,547,"Follow her,"" you said. ""She knows where to go."
1763,1,18,81,100,1.2,0.04264014327112209,547,Macy's Parade?! I think her GPS turned off at Madison Avenue!
1763,3,14,83,100,1.2,0.04714045207910317,547,In a better hallucination she'd be holding a divining rod!
1763,1,18,81,100,1.2,0.04264014327112209,547,"She may be just a mirage, but I'd follow those legs anywhere."
1763,4,12,84,100,1.2,0.04923659639173309,547,I can't believe I forgot my glockenspiel.
1763,3,14,83,100,1.2,0.04714045207910317,547,Those boots were made for walking.
1763,5,10,85,100,1.2,0.05124707431905383,547,My hemorrhoids are killing me.
1763,4,12,84,100,1.2,0.04923659639173309,547,At least the view from here is nice.
1763,5,10,85,100,1.2,0.05124707431905383,547,She must be running on Duracell's.
1763,3,14,83,100,1.2,0.04714045207910317,547,"I think the parade is over, but what the heck, let's keep singing 'Go Cubs Go.'"
1763,6,8,86,100,1.2,0.05318160234783104,547,"Bob, your cadence is all off, now we have to start over."
1763,4,12,84,100,1.2,0.04923659639173309,547,"""Well, at least we've got the Cirque Désolé to entertain us."
1763,4,12,84,100,1.2,0.04923659639173309,547,When can we say we've given her enough of a chance?
1763,3,14,83,100,1.2,0.04714045207910317,547,Isn't it time to pass the baton?My knees are killing me.
1763,2,16,82,100,1.2,0.044946657497549475,547,This is one messed up mirage.
1763,0,20,80,100,1.2,0.04020151261036848,547,I can't wait till halftime is over.
1763,5,10,85,100,1.2,0.05124707431905383,547,"It's time we take the battery out of this energizer bunny, John."
1763,4,12,84,100,1.2,0.04923659639173309,547,Can you still hear hear the band?
1763,2,16,82,100,1.2,0.044946657497549475,547,Macy's parade has got to be right around the corner.
1763,4,12,84,100,1.2,0.04923659639173309,547,Do you think she really knows the way?
1763,4,12,84,100,1.2,0.04923659639173309,547,"OK, double or nothing says she drops that baton in the next hour."
1763,5,10,85,100,1.2,0.05124707431905383,547,How much longer are you going to keep following Hillary for ?
1763,3,14,83,100,1.2,0.04714045207910317,547,"I have this reoccurring dream that I am crawling through a desert following the Pied Piper."" ""Funny, me too!"
1763,3,14,83,100,1.2,0.04714045207910317,547,The alumni newsletter did promise an extended half-time show.
1763,2,16,82,100,1.2,0.044946657497549475,547,Are you SURE this is how Macy's got started?
1763,3,14,83,100,1.2,0.04714045207910317,547,can we do the mirage with the water now please
1763,4,12,84,100,1.2,0.04923659639173309,547,Are you sure she's leading us to water?
1763,3,14,83,100,1.2,0.04714045207910317,547,How much longer are we going to on with this charade ?
1806,4,12,85,101,1.198019801980198,0.04878687126635613,547,Should we tell him the band died an hour ago?
1807,3,13,82,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04735406622354269,547,Getting stuck behind a parade always makes me feel like I'm going to die.
1807,1,17,80,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04268044887831027,547,"Why didn't she strike that rock with her stick, like Moses did, and get us some water?"
1807,3,13,82,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04735406622354269,547,Ok I give up- you can be first trombone.
1807,3,13,82,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04735406622354269,547,I like to think that I crawl to the beat of a different drummer.
1807,5,9,84,98,1.1938775510204083,0.05160614749575169,547,"If I don't make it, tell them I died with a smile on my face."
1807,5,9,84,98,1.1938775510204083,0.05160614749575169,547,This is so much better than following a sled dog.
1807,2,15,81,98,1.1938775510204083,0.0450778676534157,547,I finally got it. It's left leg planted and right arm free!
1807,1,17,80,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04268044887831027,547,We could get a cab.
1807,5,9,84,98,1.1938775510204083,0.05160614749575169,547,"Hey, you're right! Just following along without thinking is so much easier than reality."
1807,2,15,81,98,1.1938775510204083,0.0450778676534157,547,So is this what they meant when encouraging us to take the path less traveled?
1807,2,15,81,98,1.1938775510204083,0.0450778676534157,547,"If you think she knows where she’s going, where’s the rest of her band?"
1807,5,9,84,98,1.1938775510204083,0.05160614749575169,547,I hope this Majorette gets us Majorwet real soon.
1807,4,11,83,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04952576121200433,547,I should have double checked our parade permits.
1807,4,11,83,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04952576121200433,547,"Really? I voted for Trump, too!"
1807,2,15,81,98,1.1938775510204083,0.0450778676534157,547,How'd we miss the band?
1807,4,11,83,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04952576121200433,547,I thought she was gonna stop at the edge of town.
1807,3,13,82,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04735406622354269,547,Make her rain on this parade.
1807,2,15,81,98,1.1938775510204083,0.0450778676534157,547,"Yes, I know she's crazy, but I still say she marches to the beat of her own drummer."
1807,4,11,83,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04952576121200433,547,You can find just about anything on Craigslist.
1807,4,11,83,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04952576121200433,547,I'm really glad I dropped my tuba back there.
1807,3,13,82,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04735406622354269,547,For the good old days of waterboarding.
1807,6,7,85,98,1.1938775510204083,0.05360585691021162,547,He's to hoping this parade gets rained on.
1807,2,15,81,98,1.1938775510204083,0.0450778676534157,547,"I know your mirage is shimmering, but is it also high stepping?"
1807,3,13,82,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04735406622354269,547,What is it about women with batons that makes me grovel?
1807,4,11,83,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04952576121200433,547,I don't mind waiting for a drink of water. I just want to see the rest of the band!
1807,4,11,83,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04952576121200433,547,I'm beginning to think she is just a mirage!
1807,4,11,83,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04952576121200433,547,What happened to the 76 trombones?
1807,4,11,83,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04952576121200433,547,Some grand marshal *you* turned out to be.
1807,2,15,81,98,1.1938775510204083,0.0450778676534157,547,Crawl right or get out of the parade.
1807,2,15,81,98,1.1938775510204083,0.0450778676534157,547,She marches to a different drummer.
1807,2,15,81,98,1.1938775510204083,0.0450778676534157,547,"Who knows why Siri sent the local twirling champ, but at least Apple maps avoided the rock outcrop."
1807,4,11,83,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04952576121200433,547,It's called performance art.

1807,2,15,81,98,1.1938775510204083,0.0450778676534157,547,She will have to stop when we reach the horizon.
1807,5,9,84,98,1.1938775510204083,0.05160614749575169,547,I hope it's a mirage.
1807,3,13,82,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04735406622354269,547,"She puts the ""star"" in starvation."
1807,3,13,82,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04735406622354269,547,I knew I should have brought my trombone.
1807,4,11,83,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04952576121200433,547,"What do you say now, Mr. Don't-rain-on-my-parade?"
1807,2,15,81,98,1.1938775510204083,0.0450778676534157,547,She seemed so confident...
1807,2,15,81,98,1.1938775510204083,0.0450778676534157,547,I'm beginning to think we're no longer marching straight to victory.
1807,1,17,80,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04268044887831027,547,Well if this don't beat the band!
1807,5,9,84,98,1.1938775510204083,0.05160614749575169,547,She's gotta be from the Baton Death Marching Band.
1807,4,11,83,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04952576121200433,547,Do you think we've reached ten million steps yet?
1807,4,11,83,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04952576121200433,547,Thank goodness we lost the tubas back at Burning Man...
1807,3,13,82,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04735406622354269,547,When's day 40?
1807,2,15,81,98,1.1938775510204083,0.0450778676534157,547,It's the longest halftime I've ever been involved in.
1807,5,9,84,98,1.1938775510204083,0.05160614749575169,547,Is she wearing thongs in your hallucination too?
1807,4,11,83,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04952576121200433,547,Think she can really lead us to Starbucks?
1807,3,13,82,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04735406622354269,547,I'm with the band
1807,2,15,81,98,1.1938775510204083,0.0450778676534157,547,I'm getting a funny feeling that following this leader will get us nowhere.
1807,6,7,85,98,1.1938775510204083,0.05360585691021162,547,We'll get relief at halftime.
1807,4,11,83,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04952576121200433,547,I'm beginning to think this is a mirage.
1807,3,13,82,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04735406622354269,547,Band. I said I wanted to be in the band.
1807,4,11,83,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04952576121200433,547,It would have been easier to make the football team
1807,3,13,82,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04735406622354269,547,Was this what they meant by marching to a different drummer?
1807,1,17,80,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04268044887831027,547,"I don't mind the crawling so much, but I kind of wish she would change up the tune a little more frequently."
1807,1,17,80,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04268044887831027,547,Don't you know the difference between a mirage and an oasis??
1807,3,13,82,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04735406622354269,547,She said she knew where there was an oasis.
1807,5,9,84,98,1.1938775510204083,0.05160614749575169,547,I never thought it would end this way.
1807,4,11,83,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04952576121200433,547,Maybe marching to the beat of your own drum is a little overrated.
1807,4,11,83,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04952576121200433,547,I've always been a fool for a baton.
1807,2,15,81,98,1.1938775510204083,0.0450778676534157,547,This is much more intimate than Burning Man.
1807,3,13,82,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04735406622354269,547,With those thighs I'd follow her anywhere.
1807,5,9,84,98,1.1938775510204083,0.05160614749575169,547,She said it gets easier when the seasons change.
1807,2,15,81,98,1.1938775510204083,0.0450778676534157,547,This is so much better than that underwater yoga class.
1807,5,9,84,98,1.1938775510204083,0.05160614749575169,547,She's going to make America great again.
1807,4,11,83,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04952576121200433,547,"I don't know how she does it either, but I'm following her until 2020."
1807,2,15,81,98,1.1938775510204083,0.0450778676534157,547,This is the most existential CrossFit I've tried yet.
1807,3,13,82,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04735406622354269,547,"Somehow I'm not thirsty anymore. I told you, nobody rains on her parade!"
1807,4,11,83,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04952576121200433,547,I'm starting to think that's not a good dousing rod.
1807,5,9,84,98,1.1938775510204083,0.05160614749575169,547,"OK, we’re not the lead dogs, but the view isn’t so bad."
1807,3,13,82,98,1.1938775510204083,0.04735406622354269,547,This is the longest half time march I can remember.
1879,3,13,83,99,1.1919191919191918,0.04691419395962154,547,I'm thinking the whole Rain/Parade thing is a metaphor
1879,1,17,81,99,1.1919191919191918,0.042292498960325685,547,I know it's an hallucination - the best one we've had so far - and what do we have to lose!?!
1879,2,15,82,99,1.1919191919191918,0.04466316750517219,547,Thirty years in marching band. You?
1879,1,17,81,99,1.1919191919191918,0.042292498960325685,547,We've been drummed out.
1879,1,17,81,99,1.1919191919191918,0.042292498960325685,547,"So, what exactly is a mirage?"
1879,5,9,85,99,1.1919191919191918,0.05111973905892743,547,Beware the Ides of March
1879,6,7,86,99,1.1919191919191918,0.05309774745447071,547,Now aren't you glad we took the scenic route?
1879,3,13,83,99,1.1919191919191918,0.04691419395962154,547,This is what we get for following the wrong person in the desert for the last 40 years.
1879,6,7,86,99,1.1919191919191918,0.05309774745447071,547,Did we pick the wrong leader?
1879,3,13,83,99,1.1919191919191918,0.04691419395962154,547,Doncha just love a parade?!
1879,3,13,83,99,1.1919191919191918,0.04691419395962154,547,I always wanted to be in a parade!
1879,3,13,83,99,1.1919191919191918,0.04691419395962154,547,"She's cute, but this isn't the parade route"
1879,5,9,85,99,1.1919191919191918,0.05111973905892743,547,I hear she's besties with the Energizer Bunny.
1879,4,11,84,99,1.1919191919191918,0.04906204906204907,547,"Things could be worse, given the pomp and circumstances."
1879,5,9,85,99,1.1919191919191918,0.05111973905892743,547,I think we march to the tune of a different drummer.
1879,4,11,84,99,1.1919191919191918,0.04906204906204907,547,She's marching to the sound of a different drummer
1879,2,15,82,99,1.1919191919191918,0.04466316750517219,547,"Somehow, I think we've lost the parade route ...."
1879,3,13,83,99,1.1919191919191918,0.04691419395962154,547,I used to love a parade!
1879,4,11,84,99,1.1919191919191918,0.04906204906204907,547,"Ya know what, Bullwinkle? This is the best mirage I've seen all week."
1879,3,13,83,99,1.1919191919191918,0.04691419395962154,547,Guess we have our marching orders.
1879,3,13,83,99,1.1919191919191918,0.04691419395962154,547,I'll take this over a GPS any day.
1879,3,13,83,99,1.1919191919191918,0.04691419395962154,547,This is not what she had in mind for her inaugural parade.
1901,3,12,82,97,1.1855670103092784,0.04710223423323986,547,Guess they really cut back on this year's Thanksgiving Day parade....
1901,4,10,83,97,1.1855670103092784,0.04932947498266527,547,I've been following her since the 2012 Thanksgiving Day Parade.
1901,1,16,80,97,1.1855670103092784,0.042297366409248006,547,I told you that you would see things differently if you drank the koolaid!
1901,1,16,80,97,1.1855670103092784,0.042297366409248006,547,Well don't mess up the cadence now.
1901,2,14,81,97,1.1855670103092784,0.04476431433028531,547,These Macy's parades get longer every year.
1901,3,12,82,97,1.1855670103092784,0.04710223423323986,547,By the time we get to Phoenix she’ll be crawling…la di dah dah...
1901,4,10,83,97,1.1855670103092784,0.04932947498266527,547,Where is that wall when you need it?
1901,4,10,83,97,1.1855670103092784,0.04932947498266527,547,"Just you wait, we're gonna get a couple of cushy factory jobs."
1901,3,12,82,97,1.1855670103092784,0.04710223423323986,547,"She's the leader, and we're her parching band..."
1901,4,10,83,97,1.1855670103092784,0.04932947498266527,547,I wish he remembered his pantaloons
1901,3,12,82,97,1.1855670103092784,0.04710223423323986,547,"You had to yell 'Freebird,' didn't you?"
1901,2,14,81,97,1.1855670103092784,0.04476431433028531,547,"Hey, I guess I missed it. When did we lose the 76th trombonist?"
1901,2,14,81,97,1.1855670103092784,0.04476431433028531,547,"Follow her. Pasadena, New Year's Day. Guaranteed."
1901,2,14,81,97,1.1855670103092784,0.04476431433028531,547,"I've just about had it with this its the journey, not the detination crap."
1901,1,16,80,97,1.1855670103092784,0.042297366409248006,547,"I'm tired, hungry and thirsty, but just look at her twirl!"
1901,2,14,81,97,1.1855670103092784,0.04476431433028531,547,"""I hate to disillusion you, but I really don't think this is the Macy's parade."
1901,2,14,81,97,1.1855670103092784,0.04476431433028531,547,Even as a kid I hated parades.
1901,2,14,81,97,1.1855670103092784,0.04476431433028531,547,40 years more and they'll write Bible passages about us.
1901,5,8,84,97,1.1855670103092784,0.05146040938787607,547,"Will you stop singing ""Don't Rain On My Parade""!"
1901,3,12,82,97,1.1855670103092784,0.04710223423323986,547,"Back off, she's mine."
1901,5,8,84,97,1.1855670103092784,0.05146040938787607,547,I thought you said we were auditioning for the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade?
1901,3,12,82,97,1.1855670103092784,0.04710223423323986,547,"Instead of using the ""Rescue App"" on your phone maybe you should have just called 911."
1901,3,12,82,97,1.1855670103092784,0.04710223423323986,547,It still beats flying.
1901,3,12,82,97,1.1855670103092784,0.04710223423323986,547,I think we've been following a mirage.
1901,2,14,81,97,1.1855670103092784,0.04476431433028531,547,"All I said was, ""I'd follow you anywhere."""
1901,2,14,81,97,1.1855670103092784,0.04476431433028531,547,How does the Bataan Death March end again?
1901,2,14,81,97,1.1855670103092784,0.04476431433028531,547,You'll have to excuse her. My mother's a little dramatic about everything.
1901,1,16,80,97,1.1855670103092784,0.042297366409248006,547,Remember. We promised to follow her to the ends of the earth
1901,3,12,82,97,1.1855670103092784,0.04710223423323986,547,Are we completely sure this isn't a mirage?
1901,1,16,80,97,1.1855670103092784,0.042297366409248006,547,She makes me feel alive again.
1901,4,10,83,97,1.1855670103092784,0.04932947498266527,547,See? I told you these Arizona Sun Devil Half-Time shows are something else !
1932,3,12,83,98,1.183673469387755,0.04665756099726821,547,...And where do you say you bought the GPS?
1932,1,16,81,98,1.183673469387755,0.04190633754892204,547,I keep reminding myself that the path of progress has never taken a straight line.
1934,4,9,82,95,1.1789473684210525,0.049587203873582494,547,"Maybe she can-can, but I can't-can't."
1934,3,11,81,95,1.1789473684210525,0.04727501054750545,547,"Tell me, when did you drop your instrument?"
1934,4,9,82,95,1.1789473684210525,0.049587203873582494,547,I hate to rain on your parade but we made a wrong turn at Albuquerque
1934,2,13,80,95,1.1789473684210525,0.044843756048454156,547,These band camp hikes really give you a workout!
1934,2,13,80,95,1.1789473684210525,0.044843756048454156,547,What have we got to lose?
1934,3,11,81,95,1.1789473684210525,0.04727501054750545,547,Do you think if we keep following her we'll find the tailgate parties?
1934,2,13,80,95,1.1789473684210525,0.044843756048454156,547,It figures -- the mirage is wearing Spanx.
1934,2,13,80,95,1.1789473684210525,0.044843756048454156,547,These halftimes take forever.
1934,2,13,80,95,1.1789473684210525,0.044843756048454156,547,Keep going . . . she promised us a part in the Macy's parade.
1934,3,11,81,95,1.1789473684210525,0.04727501054750545,547,"You see Larry, I told you she'd lead us to Burning Man"
1934,2,13,80,95,1.1789473684210525,0.044843756048454156,547,I also marched to my own drummer when I was young!
1934,4,9,82,95,1.1789473684210525,0.049587203873582494,547,Please tell me she knows where the water is.

1934,3,11,81,95,1.1789473684210525,0.04727501054750545,547,"No idea, but wherever it is she'll make a great first impression."
1934,3,11,81,95,1.1789473684210525,0.04727501054750545,547,So when did she say she gets her water break again?
1934,1,15,79,95,1.1789473684210525,0.04227290255943855,547,I think we should've stayed to the left back there.
1934,3,11,81,95,1.1789473684210525,0.04727501054750545,547,Are you sure this is the way to the stadium?
1934,2,13,80,95,1.1789473684210525,0.044843756048454156,547,"I'm a white, blue collar worker - how about you?"
1934,5,7,83,95,1.1789473684210525,0.05179628320385274,547,It's a pity the rest of the band couldn't keep up. I had to eat the flutist to make it this far.
1934,3,11,81,95,1.1789473684210525,0.04727501054750545,547,It's not exactly the way I expected making the desert great again.

1934,2,13,80,95,1.1789473684210525,0.044843756048454156,547,Presidential inaugurations aren't what they used to be.
1934,1,15,79,95,1.1789473684210525,0.04227290255943855,547,I'm starting to lose the tempo.

1970,3,10,80,93,1.1720430107526882,0.047429620885569776,547,I told you this was the wrong bandwagon.

1970,3,10,80,93,1.1720430107526882,0.047429620885569776,547,And I thought my sarge in Basic Training was tough.
1970,3,10,80,93,1.1720430107526882,0.047429620885569776,547,and the beat goes on

1970,5,6,82,93,1.1720430107526882,0.052125589864691714,547,I think we've got trouble right here in No River City.
1970,2,12,79,93,1.1720430107526882,0.04489782674754191,547,You gotta love her enthusiasm !
1970,4,8,81,93,1.1720430107526882,0.04983295122753081,547,Are you sure that this is the way to the Rose Parade?
1970,2,12,79,93,1.1720430107526882,0.04489782674754191,547,"She's got gorgeous gams, that's why."
1970,2,12,79,93,1.1720430107526882,0.04489782674754191,547,"I said booster club, but it was your bright idea to join the marching band."
1970,2,12,79,93,1.1720430107526882,0.04489782674754191,547,"It's motivating sure, but i'm more interested in water-based mirages"
1970,3,10,80,93,1.1720430107526882,0.047429620885569776,547,"I could use a drink, but the entertainment selection is better than expected."
1970,3,10,80,93,1.1720430107526882,0.047429620885569776,547,"And here I am without my trombone, darnit!"
1970,3,10,80,93,1.1720430107526882,0.047429620885569776,547,I've heard hallucinations lead to dehydration.
1970,1,14,78,93,1.1720430107526882,0.04221446145523714,547,"Definitely, my kind of Pied Piper!"
1970,4,8,81,93,1.1720430107526882,0.04983295122753081,547,Remind me again why we chose the ceremonious dismissal.
1970,2,12,79,93,1.1720430107526882,0.04489782674754191,547,Are you sure you want to keep following Trump's program?
1970,4,8,81,93,1.1720430107526882,0.04983295122753081,547,And the band played on

1970,1,14,78,93,1.1720430107526882,0.04221446145523714,547,I think she's confused my pounding heart and wheezing for a drum and a bagpipe.
1970,2,12,79,93,1.1720430107526882,0.04489782674754191,547,"Band leader? More like 'Sand Leader,' am I right?"
1970,2,12,79,93,1.1720430107526882,0.04489782674754191,547,You're getting warmer.
1970,1,14,78,93,1.1720430107526882,0.04221446145523714,547,"We're back to ""gams"" again, I think we have covered all the terms for legs we could think of."
1970,1,14,78,93,1.1720430107526882,0.04221446145523714,547,Too bad we ditched the tubas.
1970,4,8,81,93,1.1720430107526882,0.04983295122753081,547,"She's as lost as we are, but I choose to follow her out of bitterness and frustration."
1970,3,10,80,93,1.1720430107526882,0.047429620885569776,547,I told you they'd divert the parade away from Trump Tower
1970,3,10,80,93,1.1720430107526882,0.047429620885569776,547,"Hey Harvey, get back in step."
1970,2,12,79,93,1.1720430107526882,0.04489782674754191,547,So the survivor gets WHAT again?
1970,2,12,79,93,1.1720430107526882,0.04489782674754191,547,No charismatic leader has steered me wrong yet.
1970,3,10,80,93,1.1720430107526882,0.047429620885569776,547,Have you ever heard of the Pied Piper of Hamelin? I just have a feeling that this isn't going to end well...
1970,2,12,79,93,1.1720430107526882,0.04489782674754191,547,"I'd like to think she's leading us out of our national nightmare, but there's no denying that this is the way to the Trump Las Vegas Hotel."
1970,5,6,82,93,1.1720430107526882,0.052125589864691714,547,"Back when the parade first started, she said her name is Hillary."
1970,2,12,79,93,1.1720430107526882,0.04489782674754191,547,We should probably be traveling single file to hide our numbers.
1970,4,8,81,93,1.1720430107526882,0.04983295122753081,547,This might be fun if we hadn't dropped our instruments 9 hours ago.
1970,3,10,80,93,1.1720430107526882,0.047429620885569776,547,No wonder why it never rains on her parade.
1970,3,10,80,93,1.1720430107526882,0.047429620885569776,547,Naw... you're halicinating. The 76 trombones fell out a long time ago!
1970,2,12,79,93,1.1720430107526882,0.04489782674754191,547,Simon says...STOP!
1970,3,10,80,93,1.1720430107526882,0.047429620885569776,547,"I love how Burning Man is so anti-establishment. Like, I feel so free right now."
1970,2,12,79,93,1.1720430107526882,0.04489782674754191,547,At least the water mirage is less annoying!
1970,2,12,79,93,1.1720430107526882,0.04489782674754191,547,So what if she's a mirage? I've always been a sucker for a parade.
1970,4,8,81,93,1.1720430107526882,0.04983295122753081,547,"If I told you what I saw, you would't even believe me."

2338,2,9,78,89,1.146067415730337,0.043910490827793,547,I think I can-can...I think I can-can...

2338,2,9,78,89,1.146067415730337,0.043910490827793,547,Just hope she doesn't hit The Wall.
2338,2,9,78,89,1.146067415730337,0.043910490827793,547,She's in step but I don't hear the band.
2338,1,11,77,89,1.146067415730337,0.0408994937600029,547,How does that go...Neither a leader or a follower be?
2338,2,9,78,89,1.146067415730337,0.043910490827793,547,You sure she's not a miragette?
2338,1,11,77,89,1.146067415730337,0.0408994937600029,547,And you were worried she would lead us into a dead end!
2338,2,9,78,89,1.146067415730337,0.043910490827793,547,I'm beginning to think she may be a robot.
2338,2,9,78,89,1.146067415730337,0.043910490827793,547,I'm beginning to wonder if we're following the wrong Field Commander.
2338,2,9,78,89,1.146067415730337,0.043910490827793,547,Yes I do think she should run for a fourth term.

2338,3,7,79,89,1.146067415730337,0.046727869838575666,547,I thought Trump won.
2338,3,7,79,89,1.146067415730337,0.046727869838575666,547,Forget what she said. She's can't remember the parade route either.
2338,3,7,79,89,1.146067415730337,0.046727869838575666,547,Pinch her behind see if she minds.

2338,3,7,79,89,1.146067415730337,0.046727869838575666,547,"Don't worry. This will end as soon as the guy with the tuba dots the ""i""!"
2338,1,11,77,89,1.146067415730337,0.0408994937600029,547,She told me we were playing Follow the Leader.

2338,3,7,79,89,1.146067415730337,0.046727869838575666,547,Let's ditch her at El Paso and duck into Sammy's for a drink.
2338,2,9,78,89,1.146067415730337,0.043910490827793,547,Drum majors have a sense of direction.

2338,1,11,77,89,1.146067415730337,0.0408994937600029,547,I'm starting to think he entered the wrong address in his gps for the parade route!
2338,1,11,77,89,1.146067415730337,0.0408994937600029,547,"She says to me, 'You know how to whistle, don't you?'"
2338,1,11,77,89,1.146067415730337,0.0408994937600029,547,She said she was from Macy's.

2338,1,11,77,89,1.146067415730337,0.0408994937600029,547,I thought divining rods were supposed to be Y shaped.
2338,1,11,77,89,1.146067415730337,0.0408994937600029,547,I promised her she could be in the halftime show.

2338,2,9,78,89,1.146067415730337,0.043910490827793,547,Her high step and costume are nice but I really like her sense of direction.
2338,0,13,76,89,1.146067415730337,0.03764845249025967,547,I could go for another trombonist about now.

2338,1,11,77,89,1.146067415730337,0.0408994937600029,547,At least she's not twirling fire.

2338,0,13,76,89,1.146067415730337,0.03764845249025967,547,I thought football fields where only 100 yards !
2338,1,11,77,89,1.146067415730337,0.0408994937600029,547,We should have just let the Pharaoh be drum major.

2338,2,9,78,89,1.146067415730337,0.043910490827793,547,It's been better since she got rid of the cymbals.
2338,3,7,79,89,1.146067415730337,0.046727869838575666,547,Let's try to signal passing aircraft with a baton twirl.

2338,2,9,78,89,1.146067415730337,0.043910490827793,547,I'm assuming they have concession stands at the stadium.

2468,3,7,80,90,1.1444444444444444,0.0462342488915368,547,I'm beginning to think this was a big mistake.
2468,3,7,80,90,1.1444444444444444,0.0462342488915368,547,You told me your dominatrix did home visits.
