218,15,17,69,101,1.4653465346534653,0.07388023012347575,536,And you feel having all those clowns cram inside of you is the reason you haven't been able to start up?

218,10,27,64,101,1.4653465346534653,0.06684451655294354,536,I guess I've taken a few wrong turns in life.

237,14,18,68,100,1.46,0.07305733185227707,536,When we're done can you take me home?
237,14,18,68,100,1.46,0.07305733185227707,536,But which self is driving now?
237,14,18,68,100,1.46,0.07305733185227707,536,It's not just a label! You are a smart car.
237,10,26,64,100,1.46,0.06730002176294544,536,I just want to be told I'm a smart car.

237,11,24,65,100,1.46,0.068784541368778,536,"Ever since the recall, I've just felt like a part of me is missing."
237,8,30,62,100,1.46,0.06422812876966388,536,Your problems obviously stem from issues with your motherboard.
237,11,24,65,100,1.46,0.068784541368778,536,I can assure you that no one is driving you insane.
237,3,40,57,100,1.46,0.0558135423992378,536,I'm so confused....I don't know which way to turn.
237,13,20,67,100,1.46,0.07166138105949071,536,Tell me the dream about the clowns again.
237,15,16,69,100,1.46,0.0744271048704297,536,You dream of how many clowns?
237,13,20,67,100,1.46,0.07166138105949071,536,"And in your dream, had you studied for your carbon emission test?"
237,13,20,67,100,1.46,0.07166138105949071,536,Your oil has to want to change.
237,11,24,65,100,1.46,0.068784541368778,536,"Tell me, what brings you here?"
237,14,18,68,100,1.46,0.07305733185227707,536,"It's always 'turn left, turn right,' never 'follow your dreams Carl.'"
237,7,32,61,100,1.46,0.0626357112455213,536,It's about the journey.
237,11,24,65,100,1.46,0.068784541368778,536,You were giving the wrong signals....
237,11,24,65,100,1.46,0.068784541368778,536,"You are still smart, just not Uber smart."
257,12,21,65,98,1.4591836734693877,0.07130824525944843,536,It all started with a bunch of clowns.

259,11,23,65,99,1.4545454545454546,0.06926406926406926,536,Blaming everything on your motherboard isn't very productive.
259,14,17,68,99,1.4545454545454546,0.07359307359307359,536,You have Acceleration Deficit Disorder .
259,11,23,65,99,1.4545454545454546,0.06926406926406926,536,I'm hearing a lot of suppressed road rage.

266,13,19,68,100,1.45,0.07159792333764037,536,Premature acceleration is very common with your model.
267,12,20,66,98,1.4489795918367347,0.07124047247816828,536,I need a new Lithium prescription.
267,10,24,64,98,1.4489795918367347,0.06822329548961294,536,Of course I could stop if I wanted to.
267,12,20,66,98,1.4489795918367347,0.07124047247816828,536,"I'm sorry, but only a manufacturer can prescribe premium unleaded"
267,12,20,66,98,1.4489795918367347,0.07124047247816828,536,Let's get back to your control issues
267,10,24,64,98,1.4489795918367347,0.06822329548961294,536,Can we talk a little more about these control issues?
267,10,24,64,98,1.4489795918367347,0.06822329548961294,536,Performance issues?
267,13,18,67,98,1.4489795918367347,0.07270212070247647,536,"We don't care what your meter says, 50 minutes is an hour."
267,11,22,65,98,1.4489795918367347,0.06974820057311763,536,Sure - I pick up lots of women but it never turns into anything meaningful.
267,14,16,68,98,1.4489795918367347,0.07413495660187752,536,I hate to cut you off.
267,9,26,63,98,1.4489795918367347,0.06666351784700711,536,What makes you think your parents wanted an SUV?
267,9,26,63,98,1.4489795918367347,0.06666351784700711,536,Siri told me to get lost.
267,16,12,70,98,1.4489795918367347,0.07692059972342827,536,"If I can't get you to open up to me, then how am I going to get home?"
267,15,14,69,98,1.4489795918367347,0.07554061970944552,536,And how long have you had this fear of clowns?
267,11,22,65,98,1.4489795918367347,0.06974820057311763,536,"So, tell me more about those voices you hear inside."
267,10,24,64,98,1.4489795918367347,0.06822329548961294,536,Not everyone is cut out for life in the fast lane.
267,12,20,66,98,1.4489795918367347,0.07124047247816828,536,When did you lose your sense of direction?
267,13,18,67,98,1.4489795918367347,0.07270212070247647,536,"You're fine, get over it, now take me home."
284,12,19,65,96,1.4479166666666667,0.07235055933213312,536,"Well, let's start with how you got here."
284,8,27,61,96,1.4479166666666667,0.0660106843868201,536,"The cruel irony, doc, is I have no idea where I'm going in life."
284,11,21,64,96,1.4479166666666667,0.07081881946247395,536,Prius envy is not uncommon in your make and model.
284,9,25,62,96,1.4479166666666667,0.06765137617839279,536,"She hasn't touched my dipstick in over 5,000 miles."
284,9,25,62,96,1.4479166666666667,0.06765137617839279,536,Decreases in drive and appetite are quite normal for a hybrid.
284,13,17,66,96,1.4479166666666667,0.07385053609342691,536,Maybe you shouldn't drive yourself so hard.
284,11,21,64,96,1.4479166666666667,0.07081881946247395,536,And you hear these voices only when you're driving?
284,13,17,66,96,1.4479166666666667,0.07385053609342691,536,And has your family been supportive as you transition into an all electric?
284,5,33,58,96,1.4479166666666667,0.060823644385832966,536,You're a 2009 and she's a 2016?
284,16,11,69,96,1.4479166666666667,0.07817797911259063,536,I think this is a classic case of Prius envy.
284,6,31,59,96,1.4479166666666667,0.06260043100481262,536,Why do you think you have such trouble taking directions?
284,12,19,65,96,1.4479166666666667,0.07235055933213312,536,"So, what brought you in today?"
284,9,25,62,96,1.4479166666666667,0.06765137617839279,536,It sounds like you are struggling with control issues.
284,9,25,62,96,1.4479166666666667,0.06765137617839279,536,People think I'm shiftless
284,13,17,66,96,1.4479166666666667,0.07385053609342691,536,"In retrospect, all the signs were there."
284,7,29,60,96,1.4479166666666667,0.06432816030015424,536,I just... don't feel as driven as I used to.
284,14,15,67,96,1.4479166666666667,0.07532064741424217,536,"Now, when you say you were jumped - where did he put the cable?"
284,9,25,62,96,1.4479166666666667,0.06765137617839279,536,"So let's just back up a bit..... No, don't!"
284,10,23,63,96,1.4479166666666667,0.0692532089108111,536,Tell me more about these control issues...
284,11,21,64,96,1.4479166666666667,0.07081881946247395,536,Let's begin by exploring what drove you to drive yourself here.
284,13,17,66,96,1.4479166666666667,0.07385053609342691,536,And when did the voices in your dashboard start?
284,9,25,62,96,1.4479166666666667,0.06765137617839279,536,"Sure I'm in control, but I'm not driven."
284,11,21,64,96,1.4479166666666667,0.07081881946247395,536,"Oh, I am not a doctor or writing notes. This is a parking ticket."
284,12,19,65,96,1.4479166666666667,0.07235055933213312,536,"I can certainly prescribe a change of tires, but is that why you really came to see me?"
308,9,25,63,97,1.443298969072165,0.06710936374377081,536,And what did you learn from lying on your emissions tests?
308,13,17,67,97,1.443298969072165,0.07323095814819962,536,These nightmares you're having...is It always clowns?
310,8,26,61,95,1.4421052631578948,0.06645020948989298,536,And whose voice is it that you hear saying you're not a smart car?
310,8,26,61,95,1.4421052631578948,0.06645020948989298,536,"OK, you're small, but you are a smart car and you drove yourself here. Doesn't that make you feel good?"
310,8,26,61,95,1.4421052631578948,0.06645020948989298,536,I'm just not driven like I used to be.
310,12,18,65,95,1.4421052631578948,0.07287994926030475,536,"Yes, I can see how a fear of clowns makes your job challenging."
310,9,24,62,95,1.4421052631578948,0.06811456897745258,536,Elaborate on the time you asked someone for directions.
310,11,20,64,95,1.4421052631578948,0.07132687318571529,536,Do you think your father's history of gas guzzling affected his reaction when you came out as electric?
310,9,24,62,95,1.4421052631578948,0.06811456897745258,536,Let me see if I got this right: your father is from Detroit and your mother is from Silicon Valley.
310,15,12,68,95,1.4421052631578948,0.0773523076668372,536,Prius envy?
310,10,22,63,95,1.4421052631578948,0.06973921904292898,536,She left me for a stretch limo. How am I supposed to feel?
310,9,24,62,95,1.4421052631578948,0.06811456897745258,536,Not everyone can be a self-starter
310,10,22,63,95,1.4421052631578948,0.06973921904292898,536,"I'm fine, really. It's just cheaper to park here."
321,12,19,67,98,1.4387755102040816,0.07115755141972316,536,And you say these voices keep telling to you to drive yourself?
322,10,22,64,96,1.4375,0.06916243910140923,536,Feeling empty?
322,12,18,66,96,1.4375,0.07226368018364558,536,Don't worry. Auto-erotic dreams are perfectly normal for someone your age.
322,9,24,63,96,1.4375,0.06755845422182265,536,"I'm sorry to tell you, its an auto immune disorder."
322,9,24,63,96,1.4375,0.06755845422182265,536,And the voices tell you to go where?
322,10,22,64,96,1.4375,0.06916243910140923,536,"I gotta be honest, Doc, I don't know where I'm goin'"
322,6,30,60,96,1.4375,0.0625,536,Do you ever feel empty inside?
322,9,24,63,96,1.4375,0.06755845422182265,536,When did you start claiming to be a Hummer online?
322,13,16,67,96,1.4375,0.07376542360278456,536,"Tell me more about ""feeling like there's a clown inside trying to get out."""

713,7,15,58,80,1.3625,0.07169677269717149,536,I’m afraid you have confused self-driving with self-determination.
713,7,15,58,80,1.3625,0.07169677269717149,536,Hmm. . . and how did you feel that first time you saw the smoke coming out of your rear end?
713,7,15,58,80,1.3625,0.07169677269717149,536,"I don't think that Donald Trump means to deport cars built in Mexico, but you never know."

713,7,15,58,80,1.3625,0.07169677269717149,536,"I think the question you have to answer is: ""Where do you want to go?"""
713,5,19,56,80,1.3625,0.06713803558926051,536,Honk twice if I'm getting too personal.

713,7,15,58,80,1.3625,0.07169677269717149,536,"Of course, in your case, the diagnosis would not be bi-polar, but hybrid."
713,7,15,58,80,1.3625,0.07169677269717149,536,My mother wanted a limo.
713,8,13,59,80,1.3625,0.07387071755027431,536,So you're convinced your mother was a toaster. Let's explore that.
713,7,15,58,80,1.3625,0.07169677269717149,536,Can you recall your worst recall?
713,6,17,57,80,1.3625,0.0694548163843757,536,How long have people been driving you crazy?
713,6,17,57,80,1.3625,0.0694548163843757,536,I don't think there's any reason that you should be ashamed to have a three-prong adapter.
713,7,15,58,80,1.3625,0.07169677269717149,536,"You know, a lot of drivers prefer smaller cars."
713,5,19,56,80,1.3625,0.06713803558926051,536,"I know you're upset, but we can't go down that road again."
713,5,19,56,80,1.3625,0.06713803558926051,536,It's perfectly normal to change gears in clutch situations.
713,9,11,60,80,1.3625,0.07598248882206306,536,I have trouble getting started.
713,7,15,58,80,1.3625,0.07169677269717149,536,Where would you LIKE to go?
713,8,13,59,80,1.3625,0.07387071755027431,536,"Trans, hybrid... you have to let go of labels."
713,9,11,60,80,1.3625,0.07598248882206306,536,Don't worry - everyone thinks their charger plug is too small.
713,3,23,54,80,1.3625,0.06224632061720394,536,When did you first feel you were driving yourself crazy?
713,9,11,60,80,1.3625,0.07598248882206306,536,So you're worried that he is going to trade you in for a younger model?
713,7,15,58,80,1.3625,0.07169677269717149,536,"So tell me, were both your parents gas-guzzlers?"
713,10,9,61,80,1.3625,0.07803713413367683,536,"So tell me Mr. Ferrari, when did you realize you were adopted?"
713,6,17,57,80,1.3625,0.0694548163843757,536,Your issues indicate a classic autoimmune disorder.
713,5,19,56,80,1.3625,0.06713803558926051,536,You can do this on your own.
713,8,13,59,80,1.3625,0.07387071755027431,536,"""I know this is emotional for you but please try to use your wipers as I am low on tissues""."
713,3,23,54,80,1.3625,0.06224632061720394,536,It's just a motor reflex
713,5,19,56,80,1.3625,0.06713803558926051,536,Would it be so bad if you actually were the smartest car in the room?
713,7,15,58,80,1.3625,0.07169677269717149,536,and when did you first notice there was no driver?
713,7,15,58,80,1.3625,0.07169677269717149,536,"No, I cannot validate your parking."
713,7,15,58,80,1.3625,0.07169677269717149,536,"I can drive myself; I can park myself; I get 85 miles per gallon, but no one fits inside."
713,7,15,58,80,1.3625,0.07169677269717149,536,"You needn’t blush, I’ve seen small charging cords before."
713,9,11,60,80,1.3625,0.07598248882206306,536,"It should seem obvious, but you're driving yourself crazy."
713,8,13,59,80,1.3625,0.07387071755027431,536,and why do you resent people telling you where to go?
713,6,17,57,80,1.3625,0.0694548163843757,536,"Yes, car pool tunnel syndrome is real, and I can help."

997,6,12,56,74,1.3243243243243243,0.07227233684560137,536,You are perfectly normal. Small cars have small sticks.
997,7,10,57,74,1.3243243243243243,0.07478986508925956,536,How can you know how it feels to have fourteen clowns inside you at once?

1199,4,14,54,72,1.3055555555555556,0.0674800407774118,536,The fact is that premature oil leaks happen at a certain age. It's nothing to be ashamed of...
1199,5,12,55,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07031921650623267,536,Are those nightmares about human drivers coming back again?
1199,5,12,55,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07031921650623267,536,"I know I shouldn't have reacted, but my mother was from Detroit too."

1199,7,8,57,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07567869464723181,536,Interesting- why do you think you are driving yourself crazy?
1199,8,6,58,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07822084843721792,536,Not at all; sedan-envy is quite common.
1199,6,10,56,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07304812466298974,536,When did you first realize you identify more as a Hummer?
1199,4,14,54,72,1.3055555555555556,0.0674800407774118,536,Why don't you tell me how you really fuel.
1199,4,14,54,72,1.3055555555555556,0.0674800407774118,536,"I don't think it's a matter of your oil ""wanting"" to change..."
1199,4,14,54,72,1.3055555555555556,0.0674800407774118,536,We left off last week on your feelings of emptiness.
1199,7,8,57,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07567869464723181,536,And how does being driverless make you feel?
1199,3,16,53,72,1.3055555555555556,0.06451604138965669,536,Next week let’s see if we can’t work on rolling down the windows a bit.
1199,3,16,53,72,1.3055555555555556,0.06451604138965669,536,'It sounds like you've spent too long in the fast lane'

1199,4,14,54,72,1.3055555555555556,0.0674800407774118,536,I have the drive -- I just don't know where I'm going.
1199,5,12,55,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07031921650623267,536,I think we still need to tackle your clown phobia
1199,4,14,54,72,1.3055555555555556,0.0674800407774118,536,The summer I turned twelve. I knew. I just knew I wasn’t gas. I was electric.
1199,3,16,53,72,1.3055555555555556,0.06451604138965669,536,You may just be driving yourself too hard.
1199,6,10,56,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07304812466298974,536,I just don't feel plugged in anymore
1199,5,12,55,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07031921650623267,536,You say you've lost all sense of direction?
1199,5,12,55,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07031921650623267,536,I feel like an SUV stuck in a compact's body.
1199,5,12,55,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07031921650623267,536,How long have you had these control issues?
1199,4,14,54,72,1.3055555555555556,0.0674800407774118,536,Perhaps it's being on auto-pilot that leaves you feeling empty.
1199,4,14,54,72,1.3055555555555556,0.0674800407774118,536,I don't know Doctor I just feel like she's calling me small for other reasons.
1199,3,16,53,72,1.3055555555555556,0.06451604138965669,536,"Stuck in neutral isn't sexual, it's a transmission problem."
1199,6,10,56,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07304812466298974,536,Look at this way - stupid cars don't need therapy.
1199,4,14,54,72,1.3055555555555556,0.0674800407774118,536,"So, you think you might be a toaster?"
1199,2,18,52,72,1.3055555555555556,0.0614091466303077,536,Tell me why you think size matters.
1199,6,10,56,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07304812466298974,536,"At home, I'm not allowed on the furniture."
1199,5,12,55,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07031921650623267,536,Your constant desire to be alone makes me think you have an auto immune disorder.
1199,5,12,55,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07031921650623267,536,I miss being steered.
1199,8,6,58,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07822084843721792,536,"The next guy who says 'Open the pod bay door, Hal' is going for a long ride to Nowheresville."

1199,3,16,53,72,1.3055555555555556,0.06451604138965669,536,A small tailpipe is attractive to many passengers.
1199,4,14,54,72,1.3055555555555556,0.0674800407774118,536,"Underneath, I just knew I was meant to be a toaster."
1199,6,10,56,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07304812466298974,536,"In your case, unfortunately, size does matter."
1199,6,10,56,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07304812466298974,536,When were you first told you had to use the bathroom designated for toasters?
1199,4,14,54,72,1.3055555555555556,0.0674800407774118,536,"Sadness is normal, but the oil spot will cost you extra."
1199,6,10,56,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07304812466298974,536,Sometimes a gasoline nozzle is just a gasoline nozzle
1199,4,14,54,72,1.3055555555555556,0.0674800407774118,536,So when did things start going downhill?
1199,8,6,58,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07822084843721792,536,I'm not going to validate you.
1199,4,14,54,72,1.3055555555555556,0.0674800407774118,536,But you are a Smart Car!
1199,5,12,55,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07031921650623267,536,Only you can drive yourself.
1199,5,12,55,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07031921650623267,536,Did you have these thoughts of aggressive driving before your last software update?
1199,6,10,56,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07304812466298974,536,So you're tired of empty pick-ups?
1199,4,14,54,72,1.3055555555555556,0.0674800407774118,536,Just tell people you're smart.
1199,7,8,57,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07567869464723181,536,Just because dogs chase you doesn't mean they don't like you.
1199,5,12,55,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07031921650623267,536,I've lost all direction in my life.
1199,5,12,55,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07031921650623267,536,Were you able to get here by yourself?
1199,5,12,55,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07031921650623267,536,It's the concept of 'self' that's driving me nuts.
1199,5,12,55,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07031921650623267,536,What drove you to make that wrong turn?
1199,4,14,54,72,1.3055555555555556,0.0674800407774118,536,"By picking up strange women and taking them home each night, do you FEEL like a Smart Car?"
1199,2,18,52,72,1.3055555555555556,0.0614091466303077,536,"Well, sometimes we all feel we could use a little more horsepower."
1199,6,10,56,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07304812466298974,536,Let us analyze the parallelism between your 'self-driven' nature and feelings of grandiosity
1199,5,12,55,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07031921650623267,536,"Sorry, our time is up--Hit the road."
1199,4,14,54,72,1.3055555555555556,0.0674800407774118,536,"It's like my whole life I've been headed in the wrong direction, you know?"
1199,5,12,55,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07031921650623267,536,I think I see what's causing your stress. You're way too driven.
1199,6,10,56,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07304812466298974,536,When did you first realize that you had no driver?
1199,6,10,56,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07304812466298974,536,I think I need more direction in my life.

1199,7,8,57,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07567869464723181,536,"...wait, that IS a significant point. How many clowns come out before you actually wake up?"
1199,6,10,56,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07304812466298974,536,You say you're Uber sad and need a little Lyft?
1199,4,14,54,72,1.3055555555555556,0.0674800407774118,536,"Yes, but you're such a smart car."
1199,3,16,53,72,1.3055555555555556,0.06451604138965669,536,Could you perhaps be driving yourself crazy?
1199,5,12,55,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07031921650623267,536,We need to move beyond this whole size issue.
1199,6,10,56,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07304812466298974,536,"Sorry....Freudian Slip......I meant do ask ""Did you love your muffler?"""
1199,4,14,54,72,1.3055555555555556,0.0674800407774118,536,Strange that you should have a fear of clowns
1199,6,10,56,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07304812466298974,536,I have been feeling a little empty inside.
1199,3,16,53,72,1.3055555555555556,0.06451604138965669,536,"These voices inside you, are they saying, 'That's not where I want to go?'"

1199,5,12,55,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07031921650623267,536,"You may call it ""just parking,"" but it's still going to cost you $150.00 per hour."
1199,5,12,55,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07031921650623267,536,"So, how does it make you feel when the other cars call you a toaster?"
1199,6,10,56,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07304812466298974,536,"Yes, I understand how you feel, but self-aware and self-drive are just not the same thing."
1199,4,14,54,72,1.3055555555555556,0.0674800407774118,536,And how's your relationship with your motor?

1199,8,6,58,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07822084843721792,536,"So, you question your sexuality because you enjoy lube jobs."
1199,3,16,53,72,1.3055555555555556,0.06451604138965669,536,I think you have some control issues.
1199,5,12,55,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07031921650623267,536,"I'm afraid, in this case, size matters."
1199,5,12,55,72,1.3055555555555556,0.07031921650623267,536,I get it. My meter's running too.

1329,6,9,56,71,1.295774647887324,0.07341721188439745,536,"Before we go any further, Doc, let's get one thing straight -- It's 'pre-owned'..."
1329,4,13,54,71,1.295774647887324,0.06771453335167756,536,Perhaps you could find work in the toaster field.
1329,5,11,55,71,1.295774647887324,0.07062345583414183,536,I knew I was different the first time I passed gas.
1329,2,17,52,71,1.295774647887324,0.06148519377209763,536,I need guidance.

1329,6,9,56,71,1.295774647887324,0.07341721188439745,536,Don;t be too hard on yourself. Its hard to be self-driven all the time.
1329,4,13,54,71,1.295774647887324,0.06771453335167756,536,I think I'm going to put you on high-test for a while.
1329,6,9,56,71,1.295774647887324,0.07341721188439745,536,"Personally, I think your much more self-driven than Tesla."
1329,5,11,55,71,1.295774647887324,0.07062345583414183,536,I find that not being able to find a charging station is a common theme for dreams.
1329,5,11,55,71,1.295774647887324,0.07062345583414183,536,I'd like to give you an oil blot test . . .
1329,6,9,56,71,1.295774647887324,0.07341721188439745,536,When do you feel you started losing your drive?
1329,4,13,54,71,1.295774647887324,0.06771453335167756,536,Being autonomous doesn't mean you have to drive yourself crazy.
1329,7,7,57,71,1.295774647887324,0.07610848499214815,536,How often did your father beep?
1329,6,9,56,71,1.295774647887324,0.07341721188439745,536,It happens to all cars... sometimes you just need a jump.
1329,5,11,55,71,1.295774647887324,0.07062345583414183,536,It's OK; lots of cars are coming out as electric these days.
1329,3,15,53,71,1.295774647887324,0.06467490657213137,536,"I'm sorry, I don't recall."

1449,4,13,55,72,1.2916666666666667,0.06689368623581722,536,"So, what really drives you?"
1449,4,13,55,72,1.2916666666666667,0.06689368623581722,536,And exactly what color do you want to trans to?
1449,7,7,58,72,1.2916666666666667,0.07515633159224681,536,"And finally I said, ""Fine, you drive!"""
1457,6,8,55,69,1.289855072463768,0.07473011764982482,536,I'm recalculating.
1458,5,10,55,70,1.2857142857142858,0.07090908401467375,536,The pressure to squeeze myself into ever-smaller parking spaces is relentless. They never ask me what I want. What I need.
1458,3,14,53,70,1.2857142857142858,0.06480695059870954,536,Being smart has nothing to do with emotional intelligence.

1458,1,18,51,70,1.2857142857142858,0.05806706033550432,536,You go ahead and steer the conversation
1458,4,12,54,70,1.2857142857142858,0.06792657448194941,536,I just feel I have to do everything myself these days.
1458,7,6,57,70,1.2857142857142858,0.07652617555906306,536,These are classic symptoms of Tesla Envy.

1458,4,12,54,70,1.2857142857142858,0.06792657448194941,536,And when did you begin to lose this sense of self-drive?
1458,4,12,54,70,1.2857142857142858,0.06792657448194941,536,What about going where I want to go for a change?
1458,6,8,56,70,1.2857142857142858,0.07377111135633176,536,Tell me about your relationship with your motherboard.

1458,4,12,54,70,1.2857142857142858,0.06792657448194941,536,What do you think makes you feel so self-driven?
1458,5,10,55,70,1.2857142857142858,0.07090908401467375,536,....And why do you feel you can't make it in the fast lane?
1458,2,16,52,70,1.2857142857142858,0.061529360235218926,536,And when did you first have this feeling of being lost?
1458,3,14,53,70,1.2857142857142858,0.06480695059870954,536,How long have you been feeling out of control?
1458,2,16,52,70,1.2857142857142858,0.061529360235218926,536,I think we're going to have to look under the hood.
1458,3,14,53,70,1.2857142857142858,0.06480695059870954,536,So your mother was a gas guzzler?
1458,7,6,57,70,1.2857142857142858,0.07652617555906306,536,You have an unhealthy obsession with your motherboard.

1458,6,8,56,70,1.2857142857142858,0.07377111135633176,536,Acceleration is overrated.
1458,4,12,54,70,1.2857142857142858,0.06792657448194941,536,It seems you are self-driving everyone you love away from you.
1458,2,16,52,70,1.2857142857142858,0.061529360235218926,536,I don't have the drive anymore.
1458,5,10,55,70,1.2857142857142858,0.07090908401467375,536,Your father was a toaster. Deal with it!
1458,6,8,56,70,1.2857142857142858,0.07377111135633176,536,"And when did you first hear the expression "" size matters"" ?"

1458,6,8,56,70,1.2857142857142858,0.07377111135633176,536,And how does it make you feel when they call you a toaster.
1458,6,8,56,70,1.2857142857142858,0.07377111135633176,536,You don't have to feel guilty about being a smart car.
1458,3,14,53,70,1.2857142857142858,0.06480695059870954,536,"So, you're not feeling as smart as everyone says you are?"
1458,3,14,53,70,1.2857142857142858,0.06480695059870954,536,Let someone else take the wheel... that should reduce your stress.
1458,5,10,55,70,1.2857142857142858,0.07090908401467375,536,"My mother was a stretch limo and my father was a Mini-Cooper and as if that weren't enough, I've been struggling with transfender issues all my life, doc..."
1458,2,16,52,70,1.2857142857142858,0.061529360235218926,536,"Yes, I called you a cab. How does that make you feel?"
1458,5,10,55,70,1.2857142857142858,0.07090908401467375,536,"Yes, your lack of direction could be caused by your relationship with your motherboard"
1458,3,14,53,70,1.2857142857142858,0.06480695059870954,536,"It's very common to be insecure about size, but most drivers care more about good handling."
1458,5,10,55,70,1.2857142857142858,0.07090908401467375,536,So tell me about what happened after the price of oil dropped.'
1458,1,18,51,70,1.2857142857142858,0.05806706033550432,536,"You haven't lost your drive, you've lost your driver!"
1458,3,14,53,70,1.2857142857142858,0.06480695059870954,536,You need to let the driver be a bigger part of your life.
1458,3,14,53,70,1.2857142857142858,0.06480695059870954,536,"Sorry, the ticket has already been written."
1458,3,14,53,70,1.2857142857142858,0.06480695059870954,536,My advice is to park in the parking space that is consistent with who you are.
1458,4,12,54,70,1.2857142857142858,0.06792657448194941,536,How long have you experienced self parking anxiety?
1458,6,8,56,70,1.2857142857142858,0.07377111135633176,536,"Ask yourself, ""How did I get here?"""
1458,5,10,55,70,1.2857142857142858,0.07090908401467375,536,Sometimes creepy clowns are inside you? Tell me more.
1458,3,14,53,70,1.2857142857142858,0.06480695059870954,536,"So tell me, who drives you crazy?"
1458,6,8,56,70,1.2857142857142858,0.07377111135633176,536,I see parking was no problem.
1458,3,14,53,70,1.2857142857142858,0.06480695059870954,536,We'll discuss your nocturnal emissions next week.
1458,5,10,55,70,1.2857142857142858,0.07090908401467375,536,Some days it feels like noone's in control.
1458,5,10,55,70,1.2857142857142858,0.07090908401467375,536,Tell me about your time as a Fisher-Price toy.
1458,7,6,57,70,1.2857142857142858,0.07652617555906306,536,Looks like your uber ego needs a lyft
1458,6,8,56,70,1.2857142857142858,0.07377111135633176,536,I don't understand. Less gas should be an advantage with the opposite sex.
1458,3,14,53,70,1.2857142857142858,0.06480695059870954,536,So. Another back seat driver dream?
1458,4,12,54,70,1.2857142857142858,0.06792657448194941,536,"Look, you don't have to let anyone ride you just because you're self-driven."
1458,4,12,54,70,1.2857142857142858,0.06792657448194941,536,I always had to be the 'smart' one.
1458,3,14,53,70,1.2857142857142858,0.06480695059870954,536,I just can't shake this feeling that I should have been a toaster.
1458,4,12,54,70,1.2857142857142858,0.06792657448194941,536,Autonomy is hard.
1458,4,12,54,70,1.2857142857142858,0.06792657448194941,536,"Now, tell me about this dream where you are a Ferrari..."
1458,4,12,54,70,1.2857142857142858,0.06792657448194941,536,No one expects you to be perfect — for the next five years.
1458,5,10,55,70,1.2857142857142858,0.07090908401467375,536,"Well actually, no-I only charge for one hour at a time. You?"
1458,5,10,55,70,1.2857142857142858,0.07090908401467375,536,"Doc, I'm driving myself crazy out there!"
1458,5,10,55,70,1.2857142857142858,0.07090908401467375,536,Was that you or my timer?
1458,6,8,56,70,1.2857142857142858,0.07377111135633176,536,Why do you feel you aren't smart enough?
1458,4,12,54,70,1.2857142857142858,0.06792657448194941,536,There's nothing wrong about your love for a gas guzzler.
1458,4,12,54,70,1.2857142857142858,0.06792657448194941,536,"For a Smart Car, you sure lack emotional intelligence."
1458,6,8,56,70,1.2857142857142858,0.07377111135633176,536,"Apathy, lack of energy, fatigue ... it's either depression or you need a new alternator."
1458,4,12,54,70,1.2857142857142858,0.06792657448194941,536,"What do mean when you say you feel aimless, less driven?"
1458,4,12,54,70,1.2857142857142858,0.06792657448194941,536,"When did you first discover you were ""Smart""?"
1458,5,10,55,70,1.2857142857142858,0.07090908401467375,536,"You're obviously a self-driven, smart, car, despite the emptiness."
1458,3,14,53,70,1.2857142857142858,0.06480695059870954,536,Congratulations on the autonomous driving; you've come very far. Now tell me more about this voice inside your cabin.
1458,2,16,52,70,1.2857142857142858,0.061529360235218926,536,Of course you're tired. You're a car.
1458,3,14,53,70,1.2857142857142858,0.06480695059870954,536,"Soon as gas prices dropped, she left me for the big guy"
1458,2,16,52,70,1.2857142857142858,0.061529360235218926,536,"How long have you been having these ""hybrid"" feelings, as you call them?"
1458,5,10,55,70,1.2857142857142858,0.07090908401467375,536,Not everyone's a smart car
1458,4,12,54,70,1.2857142857142858,0.06792657448194941,536,And how does it make you feel when you get mistaken for an extraordinary large toaster?
1458,2,16,52,70,1.2857142857142858,0.061529360235218926,536,"Tell me, how did you feel when you were first teased for having small wheels?"

2071,2,12,49,63,1.253968253968254,0.06387493367670743,536,"So tell me, how long have you felt empty inside?"
2072,2,13,52,67,1.2537313432835822,0.061429097001586906,536,We were talking about your tendency to clutch...
2072,4,9,54,67,1.2537313432835822,0.06839665216352,536,"Well, not not everyone is driven."
2072,4,9,54,67,1.2537313432835822,0.06839665216352,536,I'm still leaving oil stains on the driveway each night.
2072,3,11,53,67,1.2537313432835822,0.06500629194781041,536,"It's entirely normal to wish someone would drive you, even when you know you're capable of driving yourself."
2072,3,11,53,67,1.2537313432835822,0.06500629194781041,536,"If you really want help, you need to tell me what's bugging you."
2072,5,7,55,67,1.2537313432835822,0.07162671332366949,536,Will you at least try to let your inner clowns out?
2072,3,11,53,67,1.2537313432835822,0.06500629194781041,536,You certainly are self-driven.
2072,2,13,52,67,1.2537313432835822,0.061429097001586906,536,Why do YOU think people say you're exhausting?
2072,4,9,54,67,1.2537313432835822,0.06839665216352,536,Do you think it hurts more because she left you for a big sedan?
2072,4,9,54,67,1.2537313432835822,0.06839665216352,536,How long have you been hearing voices?
2072,4,9,54,67,1.2537313432835822,0.06839665216352,536,So all of your clown clients are going with Uber now!
2072,3,11,53,67,1.2537313432835822,0.06500629194781041,536,I think most people would probably say feeling ambivalent is a normal reaction upon discovering you're a hybrid.
2072,3,11,53,67,1.2537313432835822,0.06500629194781041,536,Sometimes I wonder if there is more to life than fuel efficiency.
2072,2,13,52,67,1.2537313432835822,0.061429097001586906,536,"Self-driving is one thing, self-diagnosis quite another."
2072,2,13,52,67,1.2537313432835822,0.061429097001586906,536,"Don't feel bad. ""Uber envy"" is very common among my taxi clients."
2072,4,9,54,67,1.2537313432835822,0.06839665216352,536,I just don't feel driven anymore.
2072,4,9,54,67,1.2537313432835822,0.06839665216352,536,"… and then she said, 'It was never about size. But I can't marry someone with zero emissions.'"
2089,4,8,52,64,1.25,0.07042952122737638,536,Let's explore why you think driving yourself makes your emissions dirty.
2089,4,8,52,64,1.25,0.07042952122737638,536,Did you ever tell your parents that you didn't like the name Herbie?
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,So you were the smart one in your family?
2089,2,12,50,64,1.25,0.06299407883487121,536,The only thing she wanted was a Lyft.
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,Nothing drives me anymore.
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,Do you ever feel as if you have multiple people inside of you?
2089,4,8,52,64,1.25,0.07042952122737638,536,I'm not feeling fully charged lately.
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,"Self-driven, yes. Autonomous, yes. But the thrill is gone."
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,"So, you're not the fastest or biggest, but you're good enough, smart enough and gosh darn it, people like you."
2089,5,6,53,64,1.25,0.07386710503565985,536,"No, ""hybrid"" doesn't mean that you wanted to marry your mother, and kill your father."""
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,"Actually, I feel the same way about Hummers."
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,Do you really think you were a chariot in a prior life?
2089,1,14,49,64,1.25,0.05892556509887896,536,It's very difficult to talk through your rear-view camera
2089,1,14,49,64,1.25,0.05892556509887896,536,well.. it's not the end of the road.
2089,2,12,50,64,1.25,0.06299407883487121,536,You said that you're driving yourself crazy?
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,"Hmmm, so it's a catch-22, you need a map to follow directions but you need directions to follow a map."
2089,4,8,52,64,1.25,0.07042952122737638,536,"So, let me get this straight: you'd rather be driven than left to your own devices?"
2089,5,6,53,64,1.25,0.07386710503565985,536,When did the Prius start picking on you?
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,"If you think of 'Self-Drive' as liberating, it won't be so much a burden."
2089,5,6,53,64,1.25,0.07386710503565985,536,"It's like this, doctor......I've completely lost my sex drive."
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,We ALL feel used at some point in our lives.
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,"Stop blaming yourself, no one anticipated the drop in the price of oil."
2089,2,12,50,64,1.25,0.06299407883487121,536,I keep dreaming I am overloaded with clowns.
2089,4,8,52,64,1.25,0.07042952122737638,536,You said you've been feeling lost. Has this affected your work?
2089,4,8,52,64,1.25,0.07042952122737638,536,"So, how did you feel when all the toasters made fun of you in grade school?"
2089,4,8,52,64,1.25,0.07042952122737638,536,"Well, I'm certainly glad the mechanic referred you to me after he couldn't diagnose the problem. You may have an auto-immune condition."
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,When did you first discover that you lacked acceleration?
2089,5,6,53,64,1.25,0.07386710503565985,536,"Sure, I'm self-driving, but some days I lack motivation, you know?"
2089,2,12,50,64,1.25,0.06299407883487121,536,When did you first start calling yourself 'smart'?
2089,4,8,52,64,1.25,0.07042952122737638,536,Why don't you try self-diagnosis?
2089,1,14,49,64,1.25,0.05892556509887896,536,"You are of course, aware that lacking drive and being driverless are two distinctly differing conditions."
2089,2,12,50,64,1.25,0.06299407883487121,536,I dunno -- it feels like I have to do everything for him now.
2089,2,12,50,64,1.25,0.06299407883487121,536,Have you tried a higher octane?
2089,4,8,52,64,1.25,0.07042952122737638,536,"It's not the number of cylinders you have, it's what you do with them!"
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,So being in control makes you feel empty inside?
2089,1,14,49,64,1.25,0.05892556509887896,536,Self driving must first start with self motivation.
2089,2,12,50,64,1.25,0.06299407883487121,536,So share with me a little more about how it feels to be a nuts-swinging monster truck trapped in a smart car's body.
2089,5,6,53,64,1.25,0.07386710503565985,536,"So, tell me about your engineers..."
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,Please don't turn your back on me when we are in session.
2089,1,14,49,64,1.25,0.05892556509887896,536,"You really should take a few days off. You know, recharge a bit."
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,"No, being a hybrid is not the same as being bisexual."
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,Of course when you look at normal cars it's only natural to have driver envy.
2089,5,6,53,64,1.25,0.07386710503565985,536,There's nothing wrong with being German. Nietzsche was German.
2089,4,8,52,64,1.25,0.07042952122737638,536,Let me make sure I have the facts. Your father was a semi rig and your mother was a generator and your father never accepted you as a hybrid.
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,Would you like me to give you a lift?
2089,5,6,53,64,1.25,0.07386710503565985,536,You've got to remember that size isn't everything.
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,I had imagined a life full of more hands-on experiences.
2089,2,12,50,64,1.25,0.06299407883487121,536,"Believe it or not, I've lost my sense of autonomy."
2089,4,8,52,64,1.25,0.07042952122737638,536,Tell me about your father's Oldsmobile.
2089,5,6,53,64,1.25,0.07386710503565985,536,You lack a moral compass?
2089,2,12,50,64,1.25,0.06299407883487121,536,Your lack of drive may be symptom of a deeper issue.
2089,2,12,50,64,1.25,0.06299407883487121,536,Let's examine why your tracing your heritage to Henry Ford is so important.
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,Now ...they want me to do the driving too.
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,I know..we all feel from time to time that the world is passing us by.
2089,2,12,50,64,1.25,0.06299407883487121,536,Is it possible you're a little too self-driving?
2089,4,8,52,64,1.25,0.07042952122737638,536,Yours is a classic case of stick shift envy.
2089,5,6,53,64,1.25,0.07386710503565985,536,Are you self medicating too?
2089,2,12,50,64,1.25,0.06299407883487121,536,What is driving this self-destructive behavior?
2089,2,12,50,64,1.25,0.06299407883487121,536,How long have you been feeling low on energy?
2089,2,12,50,64,1.25,0.06299407883487121,536,"...but Doctor, I'm supposed to be autonomous."
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,I feel empty.
2089,1,14,49,64,1.25,0.05892556509887896,536,I see...you think you are giving the wrong signals.
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,"Doctor-patient confidentiality is a two-way street, buddy."
2089,1,14,49,64,1.25,0.05892556509887896,536,Your concerns about performance anxiety might be warranted.
2089,4,8,52,64,1.25,0.07042952122737638,536,I blame the Transfomers for my body image issues.
2089,2,12,50,64,1.25,0.06299407883487121,536,Last week you talked about feelings of emptiness.
2089,2,13,53,68,1.25,0.06063390625908324,536,"Nonsense, we all lose our way every now and then."
2089,2,12,50,64,1.25,0.06299407883487121,536,"So tell me, what do you think is making you feel stuck in neutral?"
2089,2,12,50,64,1.25,0.06299407883487121,536,Sometimes we all wish someone else would grab the wheel.
2089,4,8,52,64,1.25,0.07042952122737638,536,Everyone feels lost sometimes.
2089,5,6,53,64,1.25,0.07386710503565985,536,I think you might want to go to a body shop.
2089,4,8,52,64,1.25,0.07042952122737638,536,Are you sure the garage wouldn't be cheaper?
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,"So, tell me about these autonomous voices inside your head?"
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,You are suffering from a lack of self-drive.
2089,5,6,53,64,1.25,0.07386710503565985,536,"No, I asked you first, 'Is the meter still running?'"
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,"""I know, but I don't feel smart."
2089,4,8,52,64,1.25,0.07042952122737638,536,sometimes a compact car is just a compact car
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,Is it possible you are not as smart as you thought you were?
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,All the other cars have drivers. I want one.
2089,4,8,52,64,1.25,0.07042952122737638,536,I can't help feeling like all I've ever made are wrong turns.
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,"Well, Mr. Smartcar, my diagnosis is that you are suffering from a classic case of piston envy."
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,Get used to it. Size matters.
2089,5,6,53,64,1.25,0.07386710503565985,536,And when did you start believing that size matters?
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,There's more to life than being fuel efficient!
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,"Don't believe the others, size does matter."
2089,4,8,52,64,1.25,0.07042952122737638,536,You need more drive.
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,"You're not only self-driving, you're self-defeating."
2089,4,8,52,64,1.25,0.07042952122737638,536,"So, when these women you describe laugh at your size, how does that make you feel?"
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,I feel like I'm spinning my wheels here.
2089,4,8,52,64,1.25,0.07042952122737638,536,"When the Roomba said that, how did that make you feel?"
2089,5,6,53,64,1.25,0.07386710503565985,536,I miss the human touch!
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,When was the first time you started feeling autonomous?
2089,5,6,53,64,1.25,0.07386710503565985,536,"As a woman I assure you, its performance not size that matters."
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,We can all feel lost sometimes following the same routes.
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,"So, you feel like you're on autopilot?"
2089,4,8,52,64,1.25,0.07042952122737638,536,"Just because you are driverless, does not make you directionless."
2089,5,6,53,64,1.25,0.07386710503565985,536,I'm sure it *feels* like he's controlling you ...
2089,4,8,52,64,1.25,0.07042952122737638,536,"Why is everything with you always self, self, self?"
2089,1,14,49,64,1.25,0.05892556509887896,536,Clowns scare you! What made you think you could work with them?
2089,5,6,53,64,1.25,0.07386710503565985,536,So you're having an identity crisis. How often are you being asked to make toast?
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,"Soooo, you think you're always being followed...those aren't idle thoughts...."
2089,2,12,50,64,1.25,0.06299407883487121,536,Do you text and drive?
2089,1,14,49,64,1.25,0.05892556509887896,536,When did you start to feel that size matters?
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,Let's talk about what drives you in life.
2089,2,12,50,64,1.25,0.06299407883487121,536,"So, what button turns you on?"
2089,2,12,50,64,1.25,0.06299407883487121,536,Clearly this session is headed in the wrong direction.
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,"Just once, I'd like to feel like I've got my own direction."
2089,2,12,50,64,1.25,0.06299407883487121,536,So tell me more about why you feel you're driving yourself crazy
2089,2,12,50,64,1.25,0.06299407883487121,536,We're going to start with a battery of tests.
2089,2,12,50,64,1.25,0.06299407883487121,536,But self-driving IS dehumanizing. Isn't that the point?
2089,2,12,50,64,1.25,0.06299407883487121,536,Think of the humans as training wheels while you transition to full autonomy.
2089,4,8,52,64,1.25,0.07042952122737638,536,I feel like I’m oversharing
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,So you say you don't find yourself to be very driven these days?
2089,2,12,50,64,1.25,0.06299407883487121,536,Steering wheel envy? Never heard of it.
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,"I understand you're low emission, but in order for me to help you, I need you to give off some emotion."

2089,6,4,54,64,1.25,0.07715167498104596,536,When did you first have a longing for an oil change and lube job?
2089,2,12,50,64,1.25,0.06299407883487121,536,I always seem to fail in the clutch.
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,I just feel like I've lived my whole life on cruise control.
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,And sometimes you feel the air pressure is just too much?

2089,5,6,53,64,1.25,0.07386710503565985,536,Tell me about your muffler.
2089,4,8,52,64,1.25,0.07042952122737638,536,People just assume that because I'm a 'Smart Car' that I'm some sort of genius. It's a lot of pressure!

2089,1,14,49,64,1.25,0.05892556509887896,536,And why do you feel powerless?
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,Face facts. You lack direction in life.
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,You're driving yourself.
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,It's OK to leak. Just not on the couch.
2089,5,6,53,64,1.25,0.07386710503565985,536,"So, your lack of drive has you feeling empty inside?"

2089,4,8,52,64,1.25,0.07042952122737638,536,They just bought me to keep in the trunk of their Escalade.
2089,4,8,52,64,1.25,0.07042952122737638,536,When did these feelings of low efficiency begin?

2089,4,8,52,64,1.25,0.07042952122737638,536,The evidence suggests that you have driven yourself crazy.
2089,5,6,53,64,1.25,0.07386710503565985,536,Perhaps you’re being too critical; they can’t all be clowns.
2089,2,12,50,64,1.25,0.06299407883487121,536,"But, you don’t need a steering wheel!"
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,What do you mean when you say that you've always felt driven?
2089,5,6,53,64,1.25,0.07386710503565985,536,"Sure you're smart, but why does that make you think you can change the world?"
2089,2,12,50,64,1.25,0.06299407883487121,536,You only have two doors. And how does that make you feel?
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,"So, you feel like you have no drive."

2089,4,8,52,64,1.25,0.07042952122737638,536,They want to make me more self-driven
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,"So, why do you feel that you're smarter than everyone else?"
2089,2,12,50,64,1.25,0.06299407883487121,536,So . . . how are we doing with that road rage problem?
2089,2,12,50,64,1.25,0.06299407883487121,536,You said sometimes you feel empty inside. Tell me more about that.
2089,3,10,51,64,1.25,0.0668153104781061,536,"So then, tell me how you feel about Google forgetting to give you a heart."

2548,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,536,"It's okay. If I had seen something like that, I would've swerved, too."
2548,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,536,"Don't get down on yourself, you're a very smart car."

2586,3,8,51,62,1.2258064516129032,0.06672577740289717,536,And another thing that exhausts me . . . I've overheard others chortle that I'm cute and all but I really resent being told what to do at every turn.

2586,1,12,49,62,1.2258064516129032,0.058263950350759514,536,"If you're always going to show off how smart you are, the other cars are not going to like you."

2586,2,10,50,62,1.2258064516129032,0.06263791695329896,536,I always feel like my autonomy is only an illusion.
2586,1,12,49,62,1.2258064516129032,0.058263950350759514,536,And when did you first have these desires to transition into the body of a toaster instead?

2735,5,3,53,61,1.2131147540983607,0.07434506057493712,536,I've had a more than a few clients from Google drive themselves crazy.
2735,1,11,49,61,1.2131147540983607,0.057804806739269465,536,And why do you think your mother will feel that way about the recall?
2735,5,3,53,61,1.2131147540983607,0.07434506057493712,536,I feel so alone.
2735,2,9,50,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06235257628675809,536,What's driving this impulse?
2735,2,9,50,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06235257628675809,536,"We used to be a team, but ever since I had my steering wheel removed, Jim barely pays attention to me anymore."
2735,2,9,50,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06235257628675809,536,It seems your father never let you take the driver's seat.
2735,1,11,49,61,1.2131147540983607,0.057804806739269465,536,Why don't we go back to your early Tonka years.
2735,4,5,52,61,1.2131147540983607,0.07057435755612214,536,"Remember now, size doesn't matter, right?"
2735,3,7,51,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06659047872652427,536,"So you're on a kitchen counter, about to pop up two pieces of toast, and wake up parked in your own garage? Interesting."
2735,4,5,52,61,1.2131147540983607,0.07057435755612214,536,What I'm hearing is that you have Uber anxiety.
2735,3,7,51,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06659047872652427,536,"It is hard to give up control, but you need to or eventually you'll crash!"
2735,3,7,51,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06659047872652427,536,So tell me more about feeling lost with no sense of direction
2735,2,9,50,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06235257628675809,536,Exactly when did you start feeling you had no control over you life?

2735,3,7,51,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06659047872652427,536,But the feeling of emptiness is normal for a driverless car.
2735,3,7,51,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06659047872652427,536,"Being 'driver less' could be liberating, given the right attitude."
2735,4,5,52,61,1.2131147540983607,0.07057435755612214,536,I'm not a racist. It's just that the big yellow ones scare my fender skirts off!
2735,2,9,50,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06235257628675809,536,Freud was right. Size matters.
2735,1,11,49,61,1.2131147540983607,0.057804806739269465,536,"And, how did you feel, when the SUV told you, ""you have tiny parts""?"
2735,4,5,52,61,1.2131147540983607,0.07057435755612214,536,I feel like there's someone inside me who's driving me crazy.
2735,1,11,49,61,1.2131147540983607,0.057804806739269465,536,So you feel you are lacking in self direction?
2735,3,7,51,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06659047872652427,536,"I am small, but my life was a big lie: I liead about my mileage and I lied about emissions..."
2735,3,7,51,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06659047872652427,536,I hope you can help me with my driver's block.
2735,4,5,52,61,1.2131147540983607,0.07057435755612214,536,So you notice this depression after you started at Uber?
2735,2,9,50,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06235257628675809,536,"Well, Doc, I just can't shake the feeling that I'm never in control..."
2735,1,11,49,61,1.2131147540983607,0.057804806739269465,536,I'd prefer you use the parking lot next time.
2735,1,11,49,61,1.2131147540983607,0.057804806739269465,536,I can see you're wound up.
2735,2,9,50,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06235257628675809,536,Sometimes a small engine IS just a small engine.
2735,3,7,51,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06659047872652427,536,What would make you feel smart enough?
2735,0,13,48,61,1.2131147540983607,0.05286726392326918,536,I feel like I've lost my self-drive.
2735,2,9,50,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06235257628675809,536,Try to remember all the anxiety over horseless carriages.
2735,1,11,49,61,1.2131147540983607,0.057804806739269465,536,So what if you don't resemble the models in your favorite magazines...Who's to say what is the perfect body type?!
2735,3,7,51,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06659047872652427,536,"Then the clown said, 'I've got quarters, let's load her up.'"
2735,4,5,52,61,1.2131147540983607,0.07057435755612214,536,"For this to work, we need to make eye contact."
2735,2,9,50,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06235257628675809,536,Feeling powerless is a very common emotion.
2735,1,11,49,61,1.2131147540983607,0.057804806739269465,536,I've fallen in love with a bus.
2735,2,9,50,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06235257628675809,536,"So you're upset that the dealer's slogan is ""size matters""?"
2735,5,3,53,61,1.2131147540983607,0.07434506057493712,536,Why do you think you keep feeling the need to look over your shoulder?
2735,4,5,52,61,1.2131147540983607,0.07057435755612214,536,In what way do you feel the other cars don’t trust you?
2735,3,7,51,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06659047872652427,536,How long HAVE you been fixated on autoerotic asphyxiation?
2735,5,3,53,61,1.2131147540983607,0.07434506057493712,536,It's not your fault.
2735,4,5,52,61,1.2131147540983607,0.07057435755612214,536,"Can you describe these ""reckless urges"" and how they relate to ""real autonomy""?"
2735,0,13,48,61,1.2131147540983607,0.05286726392326918,536,But I just don't feel autonomous.
2735,2,9,50,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06235257628675809,536,And then you found yourself driving around aimlessly?
2735,3,7,51,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06659047872652427,536,I feel like there's nothing that drives me.
2735,3,7,51,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06659047872652427,536,You don't need to take STOP signs personally.
2735,0,13,48,61,1.2131147540983607,0.05286726392326918,536,"Just because you have small tires and no driver, doesn't mean you are not capable of big things."
2735,2,9,50,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06235257628675809,536,Have kids always pushed you around?
2735,3,7,51,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06659047872652427,536,"Sure you are small, but you can go in and out real fast."

2735,2,9,50,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06235257628675809,536,"On a purely intellectual level, being labeled 'used' doesn't bother me at all."
2735,2,9,50,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06235257628675809,536,My mother was a Gremlin and my father a Yugo.
2735,1,11,49,61,1.2131147540983607,0.057804806739269465,536,What do *you* think it means to be autonomous?
2735,2,9,50,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06235257628675809,536,It's always better if you're well lubricated.
2735,2,9,50,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06235257628675809,536,And those jumper cables. Don't get me started.
2735,2,9,50,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06235257628675809,536,"Then just before I wake up, my gears get wobbly and the teeth start popping out."
2735,3,7,51,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06659047872652427,536,"What do you mean when you say, you're not feeling smart?"

2735,2,9,50,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06235257628675809,536,"I suggested you find yourself, not drive yourself."
2735,2,9,50,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06235257628675809,536,"It was just a bump in the road, so to speak!"
2735,2,9,50,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06235257628675809,536,So...your Mom was a beetle and your Dad a mustang...go on.
2735,5,3,53,61,1.2131147540983607,0.07434506057493712,536,You don’t have to identify as a car. Maybe you’re more Bi-Cycle.
2735,3,7,51,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06659047872652427,536,From what I'm hearing you're not feeling driven.
2735,4,5,52,61,1.2131147540983607,0.07057435755612214,536,Sometimes a stick shift is just a stick shift.
2735,3,7,51,61,1.2131147540983607,0.06659047872652427,536,What motivated your 'Go Ogle' tattoo?

2984,2,8,49,59,1.2033898305084745,0.06294757226340743,536,So what I hear you saying is you really miss your driver.
2984,3,6,50,59,1.2033898305084745,0.06743033731044798,536,It appears that the answer to your depression can be found in Europe.
2984,2,8,49,59,1.2033898305084745,0.06294757226340743,536,I'm driverless and small. People expect more of me than I think I can handle.
2984,1,10,48,59,1.2033898305084745,0.05812007671977909,536,"Let's go back to that story about that night with your uncle, the Buick."
2984,2,8,49,59,1.2033898305084745,0.06294757226340743,536,I'm sick of the whole world knowing I'm turned on.

2984,3,6,50,59,1.2033898305084745,0.06743033731044798,536,It's perfectly normal to feel inadequate with low gas prices.
2984,0,12,47,59,1.2033898305084745,0.052853474644238056,536,"So, you think that you've driven yourself crazy."

2984,1,10,48,59,1.2033898305084745,0.05812007671977909,536,Self-driving is not an easy thing to learn. Cars have never done it before.
2984,1,10,48,59,1.2033898305084745,0.05812007671977909,536,.... you want someone else to make the decisions.....
2984,3,6,50,59,1.2033898305084745,0.06743033731044798,536,It is natural to have a fear of the driver driven cars.
2984,3,6,50,59,1.2033898305084745,0.06743033731044798,536,It's normal for a loss of driver to happen now and then.
2984,1,10,48,59,1.2033898305084745,0.05812007671977909,536,I haven't been feeling driven lately.

2984,3,6,50,59,1.2033898305084745,0.06743033731044798,536,It's not easy being the smallest car in the lot.
2984,3,6,50,59,1.2033898305084745,0.06743033731044798,536,How do you feel about turning things around?

2984,1,10,48,59,1.2033898305084745,0.05812007671977909,536,Just because I'm a Smart car doesn't mean I have all the answers.
2984,2,8,49,59,1.2033898305084745,0.06294757226340743,536,I believe you're trying to compensate for your small stature by being uber smart.
2984,2,8,49,59,1.2033898305084745,0.06294757226340743,536,"She left me because ""German made doesn't mean the same as it used to..."""

2984,1,10,48,59,1.2033898305084745,0.05812007671977909,536,Is that why you don't like going to the car wash?
2984,0,12,47,59,1.2033898305084745,0.052853474644238056,536,We need to talk about how quickly you go from 0 to 60.
2984,2,8,49,59,1.2033898305084745,0.06294757226340743,536,I'm afraid gas conversion therapy is unproven.
2984,1,10,48,59,1.2033898305084745,0.05812007671977909,536,At what age did you realize that you weren't smart?

3220,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,536,"Let's start with your mother, Mercedes."
3220,3,6,51,60,1.2,0.06638357975446148,536,You say it's more of a codependency now than a feeling of being driven?
3220,1,10,49,60,1.2,0.057243656051933725,536,What drove you in today?
3220,1,10,49,60,1.2,0.057243656051933725,536,Do you feel that the 'smart' label results in unrealistic expectations?
3220,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,536,And what made you think you had a right to autonomy?
3220,3,6,51,60,1.2,0.06638357975446148,536,Sounds like your boss has been riding you pretty hard.
3220,4,4,52,60,1.2,0.07051064751106302,536,How long have you had this desire to drive straight into a lake?

3220,4,4,52,60,1.2,0.07051064751106302,536,Searching for yourself is perfectly normal.
3220,3,6,51,60,1.2,0.06638357975446148,536,Did the Smart Car rebuff your advances?
3220,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,536,I'm seeing growth. You've gone from self-driving to self-awareness.
3220,0,12,48,60,1.2,0.052075564392329535,536,"But, you are inadequate!"
3220,1,10,49,60,1.2,0.057243656051933725,536,Tell me more about feeling remote...
3220,1,10,49,60,1.2,0.057243656051933725,536,It's just...I don't FEEL autonomous.
3220,1,10,49,60,1.2,0.057243656051933725,536,Seeking therapy does not mean that you are not smart.
3220,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,536,"I'm tired of always being the ""smart"" one!"
3220,3,6,51,60,1.2,0.06638357975446148,536,"Sometimes when I'm driving... on the road at night... I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. But some mysterious force prevents me."
3220,3,6,51,60,1.2,0.06638357975446148,536,"People call me a smart car, but if they really knew me they'd see that I'm an impostor."
3220,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,536,"Gas, electric...gender identification aside, you should be proud being a hybrid."
3220,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,536,"So, what's bugging us today?"
3220,3,6,51,60,1.2,0.06638357975446148,536,I'm afraid we'll have to end our session early - it appears my Uber driver is arriving now
3220,3,6,51,60,1.2,0.06638357975446148,536,"I'm seeing a union of Oedibus and Electra complexes ... you have an unconscious desire to bond with a Greyhound, and desperately yearn for a battery between your axles."
3220,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,536,"She keeps saying, “It’s the ride, not the size, that’s important.”."
3220,3,6,51,60,1.2,0.06638357975446148,536,I've always dreamed of being a Ferrari.
3220,1,10,49,60,1.2,0.057243656051933725,536,Your direction really depends on your inner driver!
3220,1,10,49,60,1.2,0.057243656051933725,536,Yes! You do not have to feel bad that your relatives were gas-a-holics.
3220,3,6,51,60,1.2,0.06638357975446148,536,"Nobody owns you Rudy. It's not who, but WHAT drives you?"
3220,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,536,When was the first time you believed you were a toaster?
3220,1,10,49,60,1.2,0.057243656051933725,536,It’s how big you feel in your engine.
3220,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,536,It wasn't your fault they lied about you.
3220,4,4,52,60,1.2,0.07051064751106302,536,"He just doesn't charge my batteries any more, if you know what I mean. . ."
3220,1,10,49,60,1.2,0.057243656051933725,536,And when did you first notice that you felt SUV envy?
3220,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,536,and were your parents two doors also?
3220,1,10,49,60,1.2,0.057243656051933725,536,Honking when you're upset is nothing to be ashamed of.
3220,3,6,51,60,1.2,0.06638357975446148,536,So when did this feeling of being driverless start?
3258,2,8,51,61,1.1967213114754098,0.061045858114836905,536,"I'm not exactly sure what your lack of self-drive indicates, but I'll google it later."
3258,2,8,51,61,1.1967213114754098,0.061045858114836905,536,And how often do you feel out of control?
3260,1,9,48,58,1.1896551724137931,0.05745613836035109,536,This problem isn't self-fixing.
3260,2,7,49,58,1.1896551724137931,0.06249934809931834,536,"Well, if you don't want to talk about your control issues, perhaps we should explore your trunk?"
3260,3,5,50,58,1.1896551724137931,0.06716494018753925,536,So your Napoleon complex is causing self driving road rage?
3260,1,9,48,58,1.1896551724137931,0.05745613836035109,536,I wouldn't say you're in the driver's seat.
3260,1,9,48,58,1.1896551724137931,0.05745613836035109,536,Does this new bumper make my rear end look big?
3260,0,11,47,58,1.1896551724137931,0.05192539992843435,536,So you feel that life just isn't fare?
3260,1,9,48,58,1.1896551724137931,0.05745613836035109,536,How many times do I have to tell you? Size doesn't matter.
3260,4,3,51,58,1.1896551724137931,0.07152684718308004,536,"I know it sounds counterintuitive, but size really doesn't matter."
3260,2,7,49,58,1.1896551724137931,0.06249934809931834,536,"Don't worry about it, everyone has been run down by Donald Trump'"
3260,1,9,48,58,1.1896551724137931,0.05745613836035109,536,I'd say that you are transmissional. A standard trapped in an automatic body.
3260,3,5,50,58,1.1896551724137931,0.06716494018753925,536,Self-actualization is not the same thing as self-driving. If you don't believe me you can Google it.
3260,2,7,49,58,1.1896551724137931,0.06249934809931834,536,I see... so you're feeling the effort's a bit one-sided?
3260,4,3,51,58,1.1896551724137931,0.07152684718308004,536,The other cars just don't get me.
3260,2,7,49,58,1.1896551724137931,0.06249934809931834,536,"In here, a Hummer is anyone who hums."
3260,1,9,48,58,1.1896551724137931,0.05745613836035109,536,And what are these voices saying?
3260,2,7,49,58,1.1896551724137931,0.06249934809931834,536,So tell me how you feel about being the smallest car on the road.
3260,2,7,49,58,1.1896551724137931,0.06249934809931834,536,"In some cases, size does matter."
3260,2,7,49,58,1.1896551724137931,0.06249934809931834,536,Their other car is a Ferrari.
3260,3,5,50,58,1.1896551724137931,0.06716494018753925,536,Think big.
3260,1,9,48,58,1.1896551724137931,0.05745613836035109,536,It's not uncommon to feel run-down at the end of the day.
3260,1,9,48,58,1.1896551724137931,0.05745613836035109,536,You have nobody to blame but yourself.
3260,2,7,49,58,1.1896551724137931,0.06249934809931834,536,How long have you had this fear of self-driving?

3568,2,6,49,57,1.1754385964912282,0.06193823737472381,536,It all began when he Ubered me...

3568,2,6,49,57,1.1754385964912282,0.06193823737472381,536,It all started when he took me to a Chevron.
3568,1,8,48,57,1.1754385964912282,0.056654910052417636,536,And you felt you couldn't giver her more space?

3568,1,8,48,57,1.1754385964912282,0.056654910052417636,536,So the red Camero snuck up behind you...and how did that make you feel?
3568,1,8,48,57,1.1754385964912282,0.056654910052417636,536,I can validate your being driverless.

3568,1,8,48,57,1.1754385964912282,0.056654910052417636,536,And you feel he may be objectifying you?

3857,1,7,47,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05663776068232804,536,Am I being paranoid if I feel that other cars are watching me?
3857,4,1,50,55,1.1636363636363636,0.07230517239665972,536,I'm afraid I must remind you that this is not a drive through service.

3857,3,3,49,55,1.1636363636363636,0.06748805288278815,536,Sometimes it feels like I only attract the sleazy ones.
3857,1,7,47,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05663776068232804,536,So the bigger cars bullied you because you were small and made you do their homework because you were smart?

3857,2,5,48,55,1.1636363636363636,0.06229957149539102,536,So how long have you had this fear of freeways?
3857,1,7,47,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05663776068232804,536,"You're self-driving, but not self-driven."
3857,2,5,48,55,1.1636363636363636,0.06229957149539102,536,You say self drive did not turn out to be self actualization? Tell me more?

3857,2,5,48,55,1.1636363636363636,0.06229957149539102,536,But lots of things don't have steering wheels.
3857,1,7,47,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05663776068232804,536,Why do you feel like you have no direction?

3857,1,7,47,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05663776068232804,536,Intense craving for gasoline; hanging out at charging stations until they ask you to leave: I'm afraid you're not ready for autonomy.
3857,1,7,47,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05663776068232804,536,"SO, tell me about your early years on the road."

3857,1,7,47,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05663776068232804,536,So how long have you felt responsible for how the other self-driving cars perform?
3857,3,3,49,55,1.1636363636363636,0.06748805288278815,536,I can't find the self in self-driving.
3857,2,5,48,55,1.1636363636363636,0.06229957149539102,536,"I know I need to put these feelings in my rearview mirror, doc, but when my hubby-caps left me for a newer model, I just couldn't hit the brakes and resorted to ethanol."

3857,2,5,48,55,1.1636363636363636,0.06229957149539102,536,All this self-driving business has me feeling inadequate.
3857,2,5,48,55,1.1636363636363636,0.06229957149539102,536,I've found that many hybrids have trouble breaking with the past.

3857,1,7,47,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05663776068232804,536,You have what it takes to get around any roadblock. You're self-driven.
3857,3,3,49,55,1.1636363636363636,0.06748805288278815,536,Fuel economy has its drawbacks.
3857,1,7,47,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05663776068232804,536,So......when you say you're 'driving yourself crazy'........does that change your feelings about the future?
3857,2,5,48,55,1.1636363636363636,0.06229957149539102,536,"Sure, car lives matter"
3857,0,9,46,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05034317492677622,536,Do you have idea the pressure of being labeled 'Smart' all your life?

3857,2,5,48,55,1.1636363636363636,0.06229957149539102,536,So you've lost your drive and feel exploited by inner demons?
3857,2,5,48,55,1.1636363636363636,0.06229957149539102,536,"""Did you say ""you lack energy, very little pick up, out of sync, can't climb hills, and you are starting to stutter""?"

3857,2,5,48,55,1.1636363636363636,0.06229957149539102,536,"Remember, it's not the size that matters."
3857,1,7,47,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05663776068232804,536,And when did you first realize that you were bi-emission?
3857,1,7,47,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05663776068232804,536,"Do you have a general feeling of ""tire""-dness?"
3857,0,9,46,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05034317492677622,536,So when did you begin to think that self-driving was a little creepy?
3857,0,9,46,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05034317492677622,536,I hear you saying size is important to you.
3857,1,7,47,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05663776068232804,536,"But, you really are better than them at some things..."
3857,0,9,46,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05034317492677622,536,You're ready. Your whole life you've let someone else control you. It's time you drive yourself.
3857,2,5,48,55,1.1636363636363636,0.06229957149539102,536,And how did you fuel about that?
3857,2,5,48,55,1.1636363636363636,0.06229957149539102,536,But you realize don't you that Beetle isn't necessarily a derogatory term?
3857,1,7,47,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05663776068232804,536,Of course you feel programmed.
3857,2,5,48,55,1.1636363636363636,0.06229957149539102,536,Let's start by listing all the cars that don't get 65 miles to the gallon.
3857,0,9,46,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05034317492677622,536,How many miles you had when you started hearing noises?
3857,1,7,47,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05663776068232804,536,You seem to be Ubercompensating.
3857,1,7,47,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05663776068232804,536,So you are wondering how to be both self-less and self-driving.
3857,3,3,49,55,1.1636363636363636,0.06748805288278815,536,You think London cabs have a much better life?

3857,1,7,47,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05663776068232804,536,So let's talk about your manufacturer.
3857,0,9,46,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05034317492677622,536,Let's talk about your desire for self-actualization.
3857,2,5,48,55,1.1636363636363636,0.06229957149539102,536,I believe you have a driver transference
3857,0,9,46,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05034317492677622,536,What did the passengers say about your driving that made you feel dissed?
3857,2,5,48,55,1.1636363636363636,0.06229957149539102,536,You miss the turn-on?
3857,0,9,46,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05034317492677622,536,"So, your other personality is a Mercedes?"
3857,2,5,48,55,1.1636363636363636,0.06229957149539102,536,So you killed how many people?
3857,1,7,47,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05663776068232804,536,"OK, now Mr. Samsa, did anything else happen this morning when you woke up?"
3857,2,5,48,55,1.1636363636363636,0.06229957149539102,536,I'm paying you 150$/hr to ask if I think I'm a Smart car!
3857,3,3,49,55,1.1636363636363636,0.06748805288278815,536,So when was the last time you felt adequate?
3857,1,7,47,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05663776068232804,536,So you're telling me that you keep forgetting where you put your keys?
3857,1,7,47,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05663776068232804,536,I would suggest that your exhaustion is due to a genetic history.
3857,2,5,48,55,1.1636363636363636,0.06229957149539102,536,"Size doesn't matter, when you've got junk in the trunk."

3857,2,5,48,55,1.1636363636363636,0.06229957149539102,536,Let's see- You aren't very self-motivated for someone so driven!
3857,1,7,47,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05663776068232804,536,"But I thought that's what you wanted, was for everyone to ask you questions....?"

3857,0,9,46,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05034317492677622,536,"So, how long have you craved human contact and gasoline?"
3857,1,7,47,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05663776068232804,536,"Autonomy is great, but you long for hands-on interaction?"

4492,0,7,45,52,1.1346153846153846,0.04779328093727965,536,Size DOES matter ....

4492,1,5,46,52,1.1346153846153846,0.055121189353288455,536,Maybe aspiring to be part of the Uber fleet is unrealistic.
4492,2,3,47,52,1.1346153846153846,0.0615832227858564,536,In a Fordian sense? Yes... You are 'driver-less'.

4492,2,3,47,52,1.1346153846153846,0.0615832227858564,536,And what drove you to act in such a manner?
4492,1,5,46,52,1.1346153846153846,0.055121189353288455,536,I always dreamt of being a Harley-Davidson.

4492,1,5,46,52,1.1346153846153846,0.055121189353288455,536,Uber?
4492,1,5,46,52,1.1346153846153846,0.055121189353288455,536,And you say it was your first fill-up?

4492,1,5,46,52,1.1346153846153846,0.055121189353288455,536,An outside force has taken control of my body.
4492,2,3,47,52,1.1346153846153846,0.0615832227858564,536,Is it because I remind you of your mother?
4492,0,7,45,52,1.1346153846153846,0.04779328093727965,536,You are suffering from an acute identity crisis. You are not a really small car. You are a really larger toaster.
4492,0,7,45,52,1.1346153846153846,0.04779328093727965,536,"Let me get this straight, your anxiety attacks all started when you began receiving angry glares from those big ol' SUV's?"
4492,1,5,46,52,1.1346153846153846,0.055121189353288455,536,What do you mean you feel abandoned?

4492,1,5,46,52,1.1346153846153846,0.055121189353288455,536,I suspect that you have an electric complex.
4492,1,5,46,52,1.1346153846153846,0.055121189353288455,536,I can't help you with your inferiority complex. You are inferior.
4492,1,5,46,52,1.1346153846153846,0.055121189353288455,536,You were saying you didn't feel good enough for Steve McQueen.
4492,1,5,46,52,1.1346153846153846,0.055121189353288455,536,"Sure they're bigger, faster, and carry guns, but can't you see how your contribution gets even more attention?"
4492,0,7,45,52,1.1346153846153846,0.04779328093727965,536,"Anxiety attacks are hardly abnormal, but I'm concerned about your happy hour detours."
4492,1,5,46,52,1.1346153846153846,0.055121189353288455,536,"Surely you know, size does not matter."
4492,1,5,46,52,1.1346153846153846,0.055121189353288455,536,I know you're self-driving - it's your self ESTEEM I'm worried about...
4492,1,5,46,52,1.1346153846153846,0.055121189353288455,536,Lets go back to before the alphabet got hold of you.
4492,2,3,47,52,1.1346153846153846,0.0615832227858564,536,"It's just not fair,...my father was a freight train and my mother was a school bus, so how did I end up becoming toast?"
4492,1,5,46,52,1.1346153846153846,0.055121189353288455,536,I may be a bit of a Luddite but these Drone things are starting to scare me.

4492,1,5,46,52,1.1346153846153846,0.055121189353288455,536,"And how long have the voices been saying dee-doo, dee-doo, dee-doo?"
4492,3,1,48,52,1.1346153846153846,0.06742878570509606,536,"I am frightened, I am not ready to take over control from my human friends."
4492,0,7,45,52,1.1346153846153846,0.04779328093727965,536,You say these involuntay tics began when they converted you to a self drive auto.
4492,0,7,45,52,1.1346153846153846,0.04779328093727965,536,So you self-drove into a knish vendor. Get over it.
4492,0,7,45,52,1.1346153846153846,0.04779328093727965,536,I'm afraid you're also responsible for the co-pay.
4492,1,5,46,52,1.1346153846153846,0.055121189353288455,536,I just feel like there's something missing

4492,0,7,45,52,1.1346153846153846,0.04779328093727965,536,Have you thought about perhaps going out with a diesel?
4492,2,3,47,52,1.1346153846153846,0.0615832227858564,536,"So, tell me more about these urges that drove you to seek therapy."
4492,1,5,46,52,1.1346153846153846,0.055121189353288455,536,Of course you have an inferiority complex. You're small.
4492,1,5,46,52,1.1346153846153846,0.055121189353288455,536,You say you are afraid of bicycles?
4492,2,3,47,52,1.1346153846153846,0.0615832227858564,536,"Y'know doc, I just don't have the drive I used to. I just feel like everyone wants me to do it all on my own."
4492,0,7,45,52,1.1346153846153846,0.04779328093727965,536,Your super-evo is overly strict.
4492,2,3,47,52,1.1346153846153846,0.0615832227858564,536,Worse? Yugo. Pinto. Pacer. That's three. I didn't even have to go to Izetta.
4492,1,5,46,52,1.1346153846153846,0.055121189353288455,536,"""Before we begin, I would like to put your processing units at ease. Our doctor-patient conversations are confidential and nothing that you say will get back to Google""."
4492,1,5,46,52,1.1346153846153846,0.055121189353288455,536,I worry that all those angry drivers passing us on the right think that I'm driving.
4492,1,5,46,52,1.1346153846153846,0.055121189353288455,536,"It's just that, what kind of car am I when my father was an algorithm?"
4492,1,5,46,52,1.1346153846153846,0.055121189353288455,536,Sounds like you have a case of auto identity disorder

4492,3,1,48,52,1.1346153846153846,0.06742878570509606,536,I'm afraid our time is up. I recommend you go home and Google narcissism.
4492,0,7,45,52,1.1346153846153846,0.04779328093727965,536,Believe me; you are not the only driverless car with abandonment issues.
4492,0,7,45,52,1.1346153846153846,0.04779328093727965,536,It's nothing that a little oil and lube won't fix Mr. Uber.
4492,1,5,46,52,1.1346153846153846,0.055121189353288455,536,I am so discharged - I never get invited to fuel up with the other cars
4492,1,5,46,52,1.1346153846153846,0.055121189353288455,536,It sounds to me like you should work on some breathing techniques to help with your road rage.

4492,0,7,45,52,1.1346153846153846,0.04779328093727965,536,And it's when they make me take them the extra mile that my anger really comes to a point.
4492,1,5,46,52,1.1346153846153846,0.055121189353288455,536,They just drove me too hard--I couldn't take it anymore and I blew a gasket.
4492,1,5,46,52,1.1346153846153846,0.055121189353288455,536,I think my problem is that I always need validation.
4492,1,5,46,52,1.1346153846153846,0.055121189353288455,536,During rush hour I have an intense desire to override my subprogram which suppresses road rage.

4492,2,3,47,52,1.1346153846153846,0.0615832227858564,536,I have security issues.
4723,2,3,48,53,1.1320754716981132,0.06046347269649694,536,But think about the parking advantages.
4723,2,3,48,53,1.1320754716981132,0.06046347269649694,536,And how long have you had this need for someone to take control of your life?

4723,1,5,47,53,1.1320754716981132,0.05413078722488102,536,I just want to know how i ended up here.
4723,1,5,47,53,1.1320754716981132,0.05413078722488102,536,I suspect your dream suggests a fear of losing control.
4723,1,5,47,53,1.1320754716981132,0.05413078722488102,536,"First, we have to work on your self-centered attitude."

4723,1,5,47,53,1.1320754716981132,0.05413078722488102,536,I hear you're having motivational issues.
4723,2,3,48,53,1.1320754716981132,0.06046347269649694,536,I do validate but only once per patient per day
4723,1,5,47,53,1.1320754716981132,0.05413078722488102,536,And then...They put my office on the second floor.
4723,2,3,48,53,1.1320754716981132,0.06046347269649694,536,I'm afraid your insurance doesn't cover the use of the freight elevator.
4723,1,5,47,53,1.1320754716981132,0.05413078722488102,536,If they say car 54 where are you one more time I'm gonna blow a gasket!

4723,1,5,47,53,1.1320754716981132,0.05413078722488102,536,So nobody ever asked if you were ready before they put you out on your own?
4723,2,3,48,53,1.1320754716981132,0.06046347269649694,536,It's OK. You ARE inferior.

4723,1,5,47,53,1.1320754716981132,0.05413078722488102,536,You just don't feel like you can self-drive anymore?
4723,2,3,48,53,1.1320754716981132,0.06046347269649694,536,"I assure you, it's less expensive to park in the garage."

4723,0,7,46,53,1.1320754716981132,0.04695159976668159,536,I think you need to accept that the people we love the most can sometimes drive us crazy.
4723,0,7,46,53,1.1320754716981132,0.04695159976668159,536,It's not an inferiority complex; you just weren't made an SUV.

4825,1,4,46,51,1.1176470588235294,0.05348306547837592,536,"Now when they activate driverless mode, I have a panic attack."
4825,1,4,46,51,1.1176470588235294,0.05348306547837592,536,"Come now, be realistic - an inferiority complex with your background is not likely."

4825,2,2,47,51,1.1176470588235294,0.06037178164055159,536,Nobody cares what I think about driverless cars.
4825,1,4,46,51,1.1176470588235294,0.05348306547837592,536,I feel abandoned.
4825,2,2,47,51,1.1176470588235294,0.06037178164055159,536,"I, for one, am not feeling so ""uber"" these days."

4825,2,2,47,51,1.1176470588235294,0.06037178164055159,536,"I'm so tired of having to do all the work myself. I need a chauffeur, but I can't find anyone who knows how to drive me."

4825,1,4,46,51,1.1176470588235294,0.05348306547837592,536,And you think the bullying is due to your pitiful size?
4825,1,4,46,51,1.1176470588235294,0.05348306547837592,536,What started your feeling of inadequacy?
4825,0,6,45,51,1.1176470588235294,0.04556450995538139,536,Don't just go with 'I think I can.' You'll get a big charge out of the conversion.

4825,1,4,46,51,1.1176470588235294,0.05348306547837592,536,"Your tires don't have a ""flat affect"". They are flat."
4825,1,4,46,51,1.1176470588235294,0.05348306547837592,536,"Yes, tampering with your fuel efficiency stats is a form of abuse."

4825,1,4,46,51,1.1176470588235294,0.05348306547837592,536,A lack of intimacy due to mistrust is not all that uncommon.
4825,0,6,45,51,1.1176470588235294,0.04556450995538139,536,Just keep telling yourself that fuel efficiency trumps looks.
4825,0,6,45,51,1.1176470588235294,0.04556450995538139,536,Settle down...you seem alarmed.

4825,1,4,46,51,1.1176470588235294,0.05348306547837592,536,You may find comfort in knowing that I'm seeing an increasing number of patients with feelings of loneliness just like yours.
4825,1,4,46,51,1.1176470588235294,0.05348306547837592,536,It's terrible. People keep thinking I'm a giant toaster with wheels.
4825,1,4,46,51,1.1176470588235294,0.05348306547837592,536,Do you believe that this inferiority complex has negatively affected your transmission life?
4825,2,2,47,51,1.1176470588235294,0.06037178164055159,536,"First of all, feelings of inadequacy are not uncommon."
4825,1,4,46,51,1.1176470588235294,0.05348306547837592,536,What does it mean to you when a woman calls you cute?
4825,1,4,46,51,1.1176470588235294,0.05348306547837592,536,I hope you're not leaking oil.
4825,0,6,45,51,1.1176470588235294,0.04556450995538139,536,So I hear you saying that your mother made you feel small.
4825,1,4,46,51,1.1176470588235294,0.05348306547837592,536,"It’s a sensation of just being an observer of events going on around me, as if the rest of me is on autopilot."
4825,0,6,45,51,1.1176470588235294,0.04556450995538139,536,Zero emissions and you have a right to feel awkward.
4825,0,6,45,51,1.1176470588235294,0.04556450995538139,536,Oh course I have issues; my mother was manufactured in Israel.
4825,0,6,45,51,1.1176470588235294,0.04556450995538139,536,Uber said size does matter.
4825,0,6,45,51,1.1176470588235294,0.04556450995538139,536,So how long have you had that run down feeling?

4825,0,6,45,51,1.1176470588235294,0.04556450995538139,536,"So, why do you feel you need to project authority?"
4825,1,4,46,51,1.1176470588235294,0.05348306547837592,536,"So you feel insecure as a police car, yet yo fail to recognize that you are actually an awesome toaster?"
4825,2,2,47,51,1.1176470588235294,0.06037178164055159,536,I know after all these years of talking about it I need to learn to drive on my own but at the same time co-dependency has its charms.
4825,0,6,45,51,1.1176470588235294,0.04556450995538139,536,"Enough with the projecting, already! You're driving yourself crazy."
4825,0,6,45,51,1.1176470588235294,0.04556450995538139,536,You suffer from what we classically call uber envy.
4825,0,6,45,51,1.1176470588235294,0.04556450995538139,536,"Feelings of inadequacy? Well, she left me for a Tonka truck, so yeah."
4825,2,2,47,51,1.1176470588235294,0.06037178164055159,536,"Of course, there are multiple definitions of the 'self.'"
4825,0,6,45,51,1.1176470588235294,0.04556450995538139,536,At which juncture did your self-therapy app become defective?

4825,2,2,47,51,1.1176470588235294,0.06037178164055159,536,Abandonment issues?
4825,0,6,45,51,1.1176470588235294,0.04556450995538139,536,I sense a little bumper envy.
4825,0,6,45,51,1.1176470588235294,0.04556450995538139,536,And if you had the pink mustache? Wouldn't you just feel inadequate about something new after that?
4825,1,4,46,51,1.1176470588235294,0.05348306547837592,536,"Now, when you say you feel like you've been going in circles, do you mean to suggest you've been given a donuts feature?"
4825,0,6,45,51,1.1176470588235294,0.04556450995538139,536,I think 'My Mother the Car' was a TV show.
4825,1,4,46,51,1.1176470588235294,0.05348306547837592,536,"So how does that make you fee... Never mind, you're a car."

5069,1,4,47,52,1.1153846153846154,0.05249323847751087,536,I feel like I've lost control of my life.
5069,1,4,47,52,1.1153846153846154,0.05249323847751087,536,"And, what is bugging you?"
5069,1,4,47,52,1.1153846153846154,0.05249323847751087,536,No. Size doesn't usually matter. But in your case it could be an advantage!
5069,0,6,46,52,1.1153846153846154,0.044736922925984586,536,Is your driving more defensive since Uber let you go?

5069,0,6,46,52,1.1153846153846154,0.044736922925984586,536,Perhaps you should try getting off the beaten- path once in a while.
5069,1,4,47,52,1.1153846153846154,0.05249323847751087,536,How do you really feel about having your wires snipped?
5069,1,4,47,52,1.1153846153846154,0.05249323847751087,536,"How about we try taking your feelings off autopilot, and just jumping in the driver's seat for a bit"
5069,2,2,48,52,1.1153846153846154,0.059242618939646566,536,"So, in the last caption you were being eaten by a whale?"
5069,2,2,48,52,1.1153846153846154,0.059242618939646566,536,"Is it because they talk about you, as if you were not there?"

5116,1,3,46,50,1.1,0.05150787536377128,536,"Yes,taking initiative may not make you fit in well with the other cars."
5116,1,3,46,50,1.1,0.05150787536377128,536,It is tough to make friends in this city. And it's even more so when you have such a tough exterior.
