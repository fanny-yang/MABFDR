568,8,17,71,96,1.34375,0.06425709906852126,543,We still need to talk about where you were last night.
568,12,9,75,96,1.34375,0.07075427734884934,543,It's just until after the election. He's ashamed to show his face in public.

724,7,16,69,92,1.326086956521739,0.06393060853112938,543,Somehow I don't think you've told me everything.

724,7,16,69,92,1.326086956521739,0.06393060853112938,543,It's pretending we're not here again.
724,6,18,68,92,1.326086956521739,0.0620341129050875,543,We need to talk.
724,9,12,71,92,1.326086956521739,0.06756408656704575,543,I took him out last time.
724,5,20,67,92,1.326086956521739,0.06007777975825816,543,If we switched parties we would cut pet food bill in half.

724,6,18,68,92,1.326086956521739,0.0620341129050875,543,I told you it wasn't a metaphor.
767,7,16,70,93,1.3225806451612903,0.06333657564579079,543,I know they're endangered but can't we just send a check?

1217,6,11,66,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06485421389744174,543,And he just stands there like we're not even in the room.
1217,5,13,65,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06254766742241294,543,This isn't going to end well.

1217,3,17,63,83,1.2771084337349397,0.05765842505171362,543,"Well, obviously sending him to the corner doesn't work."
1217,5,13,65,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06254766742241294,543,It's time we talk about the litter box.

1351,5,12,64,81,1.271604938271605,0.06337314947017579,543,No - It's YOUR turn to take him to the curb.
1351,6,10,65,81,1.271604938271605,0.06576319676747688,543,He just needs a place to stay until after the election.

1351,3,16,62,81,1.271604938271605,0.05829984668206219,543,I assume you're undecided bigly.
1351,8,6,67,81,1.271604938271605,0.07029994309880462,543,"No, I don't want a divorce I want to talk about the elephant in the room."

1351,6,10,65,81,1.271604938271605,0.06576319676747688,543,What election?
1351,8,6,67,81,1.271604938271605,0.07029994309880462,543,I just have a funny feeling that there's something else you have to tell me.
1351,6,10,65,81,1.271604938271605,0.06576319676747688,543,I don't like metaphors.
1351,5,12,64,81,1.271604938271605,0.06337314947017579,543,We're going to need a bigger room.
1351,4,14,63,81,1.271604938271605,0.060889359484729344,543,"You can ignore it all you want, but eventually you're going to be sorry you didn't take it out for a walk."

1351,3,16,62,81,1.271604938271605,0.05829984668206219,543,All we ever talk about is the elephant in the room.
1351,6,10,65,81,1.271604938271605,0.06576319676747688,543,I also have an 800 pound gorilla.
1351,3,16,62,81,1.271604938271605,0.05829984668206219,543,It's not the elephant in the room I'm worried about.
1351,5,12,64,81,1.271604938271605,0.06337314947017579,543,Shouldn't talking about it make it disappear?
1351,7,8,66,81,1.271604938271605,0.06806937655353194,543,"Look on the Bright Side, he'll Deflate after the Election."
1351,3,16,62,81,1.271604938271605,0.05829984668206219,543,"We agreed, no politics before bed."
1351,8,6,67,81,1.271604938271605,0.07029994309880462,543,I'm letting him stay until his party finds its way again. Is that a problem?
1351,1,20,60,81,1.271604938271605,0.052740763859984746,543,There are easier ways to annoy the downstairs neighbor.

1351,4,14,63,81,1.271604938271605,0.060889359484729344,543,"Well, wouldn't you want to go into hiding also?"
1351,2,18,61,81,1.271604938271605,0.05558983853046629,543,It's time we talked about him.
1387,2,18,62,82,1.2682926829268293,0.05500754235822341,543,"Don't mention you know who, it only upsets him."
1387,4,14,64,82,1.2682926829268293,0.060233362522744895,543,He won't go outside until the Republicans change their symbol.
1387,5,12,65,82,1.2682926829268293,0.0626831084347988,543,Told you you'd be sorry for voting for Trump.

1387,5,12,65,82,1.2682926829268293,0.0626831084347988,543,We should at least address it.
1387,4,14,64,82,1.2682926829268293,0.060233362522744895,543,He said he is only hiding here until after the election
1387,4,14,64,82,1.2682926829268293,0.060233362522744895,543,We need to talk about metaphors.
1387,5,12,65,82,1.2682926829268293,0.0626831084347988,543,"Yet again nobody said hello, let alone asked the elephant how he was.

1396,5,12,66,83,1.2650602409638554,0.0620075956534203,543,I think we should just ignore him.
1397,5,11,64,80,1.2625,0.06350458470442125,543,You and your stupid cliches.
1397,1,19,60,80,1.2625,0.05260237155937825,543,"Listen, Roy, if we're going to keep this thing, let's at LEAST move the chairs toward its head."
1397,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,543,Now can we talk about the other elephant in the room?
1397,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,543,Can you at least limit the roughage in his diet?
1397,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,543,It's just until we know for sure the poachers are gone.
1397,8,5,67,80,1.2625,0.07058469640856017,543,Apparently he saw a clown
1397,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,543,It's okay... he's a rescue.
1397,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,543,I'd actually prefer to have the 800 pound gorilla back.
1397,5,11,64,80,1.2625,0.06350458470442125,543,I thought we stated 'no pets' in our Airbnb listing.
1397,7,7,66,80,1.2625,0.06830624913495159,543,The GOP was having a yard sale to get a new image after Trump?
1397,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,543,I always thought the phrase would be as successful with a smaller scale animal.
1397,7,7,66,80,1.2625,0.06830624913495159,543,He's not lost- He Just Lost- and He Won't Leave!
1397,5,11,64,80,1.2625,0.06350458470442125,543,I've lived with two humans in the room for far too long.
1397,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,543,Thank goodness the 100 pound gorilla is no longer in the room.
1397,5,11,64,80,1.2625,0.06350458470442125,543,Why did you have to say she has a wrinkly face? You know she won't forget this.
1397,5,11,64,80,1.2625,0.06350458470442125,543,"No, I mean we need to talk about the LITERAL elephant in the room."
1397,5,11,64,80,1.2625,0.06350458470442125,543,It's your turn to take him out.
1397,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,543,It says here that some animals escaped from the zoo
1397,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,543,It's your turn to walk him and don't forget the poop bag.
1397,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,543,"It was a metaphor, not a gift hint."
1397,6,9,65,80,1.2625,0.06594913172046729,543,He seems to have lost his Party.
1397,5,11,64,80,1.2625,0.06350458470442125,543,"Under the circumstances, I think we should see what we can get for him as a trade-in for a donkey."
1397,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,543,Your turn to walk him.
1397,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,543,"Well then what are we supposed to talk about, Todd?"
1397,6,9,65,80,1.2625,0.06594913172046729,543,"'He's cute,' you said. 'Can I bring him home?' you said. And now look at him."
1397,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,543,"Every time you use that expression, I think you make him feel self-conscious."
1397,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,543,"Half-way through the debate, he just turned around."

1575,3,13,61,77,1.2467532467532467,0.05891431779020231,543,We have to get up. He wants to turn around.
1575,4,11,62,77,1.2467532467532467,0.06174674356063795,543,Shall we talk about the cliche in the room.
1575,3,13,61,77,1.2467532467532467,0.05891431779020231,543,I still want to exchange him for a donkey.

1575,4,11,62,77,1.2467532467532467,0.06174674356063795,543,You really don't know what we need to discuss?
1575,5,9,63,77,1.2467532467532467,0.06445482014559827,543,Can we please talk about something else?
1575,6,7,64,77,1.2467532467532467,0.06705361541080136,543,He's too ashamed to go out in public since Trump.
1575,3,13,61,77,1.2467532467532467,0.05891431779020231,543,That's the problem with one-click shopping and overnight delivery-- no time to plan for the consequences.
1575,5,9,63,77,1.2467532467532467,0.06445482014559827,543,Did you just fart?

1575,4,11,62,77,1.2467532467532467,0.06174674356063795,543,"It feels a little tight, but there's plenty of space in the trunk."
1575,4,11,62,77,1.2467532467532467,0.06174674356063795,543,And the best part is he's already housebroken.

1575,2,15,60,77,1.2467532467532467,0.0559386569469335,543,"Maybe if we did discuss it, it'll leave."
1575,4,11,62,77,1.2467532467532467,0.06174674356063795,543,"You know, it's not going to go away just because you don't want to talk about it."
1575,4,11,62,77,1.2467532467532467,0.06174674356063795,543,"Oh Oh, Grab your shovel, He looks like he is going to take a Trump Dump."
1575,4,11,62,77,1.2467532467532467,0.06174674356063795,543,"I know you don't want to talk about the you know who in the you know where, but it's your turn to walk him."
1575,4,11,62,77,1.2467532467532467,0.06174674356063795,543,We're going to need a bigger litter box.
1575,1,17,59,77,1.2467532467532467,0.052795547552501765,543,Now can we talk about getting it out of the room?
1575,2,15,60,77,1.2467532467532467,0.0559386569469335,543,He just wants to be noticed.
1575,3,13,61,77,1.2467532467532467,0.05891431779020231,543,It is embarrassed to leave the house until the election is over.
1575,4,11,62,77,1.2467532467532467,0.06174674356063795,543,I agreed to let him hide out here from the Trump boys.
1575,3,13,61,77,1.2467532467532467,0.05891431779020231,543,"No, it's not because I'm a Democrat. I wouldn't want a damned donkey in the house either."
1575,3,13,61,77,1.2467532467532467,0.05891431779020231,543,"No, Harold, I am not speaking metaphorically. There is literally an elephant in the room."
1575,6,7,64,77,1.2467532467532467,0.06705361541080136,543,I disagree. Metaphors *can* smell bad.
1575,4,11,62,77,1.2467532467532467,0.06174674356063795,543,I told you we should have voted Democratic.
1575,2,15,60,77,1.2467532467532467,0.0559386569469335,543,It won't go away unless we talk about it.
1575,2,15,60,77,1.2467532467532467,0.0559386569469335,543,"After the parade he doesn't come back, right?"
1575,4,11,62,77,1.2467532467532467,0.06174674356063795,543,"Okay, Harold! We've been avoiding this for too long!"
1575,5,9,63,77,1.2467532467532467,0.06445482014559827,543,I don't know what you're talking about.
1575,4,11,62,77,1.2467532467532467,0.06174674356063795,543,How come we never talk about the one ounce canary in the room?
1575,3,13,61,77,1.2467532467532467,0.05891431779020231,543,Hasn't this tif with the condo association gone far enough?
1575,4,11,62,77,1.2467532467532467,0.06174674356063795,543,Do you know what will happen when he loses?
1575,4,11,62,77,1.2467532467532467,0.06174674356063795,543,Are you sure you checked the Lost & Found section?
1575,4,11,62,77,1.2467532467532467,0.06174674356063795,543,I do so smell gas.
1575,3,13,61,77,1.2467532467532467,0.05891431779020231,543,"Don't worry, he is on his way out"
1575,3,13,61,77,1.2467532467532467,0.05891431779020231,543,'Can we talk about something else for a change?'
1575,3,13,61,77,1.2467532467532467,0.05891431779020231,543,It’s definitely your turn to clean out the litter tray
1575,2,15,60,77,1.2467532467532467,0.0559386569469335,543,I have no idea what you're talking about

1575,4,11,62,77,1.2467532467532467,0.06174674356063795,543,Could we please discuss something besides politics for a change?
1575,5,9,63,77,1.2467532467532467,0.06445482014559827,543,"Regardless of what happened in college, Richard, my feelings about threesomes aren't going to change now."

1575,1,17,59,77,1.2467532467532467,0.052795547552501765,543,"OK, you proved your point. There are some elephants in the room that people will talk about."
1575,3,13,61,77,1.2467532467532467,0.05891431779020231,543,What's that smell?
1575,5,9,63,77,1.2467532467532467,0.06445482014559827,543,You're sure there's no notice about a lost elephant in the classifieds? Check again.
1575,5,9,63,77,1.2467532467532467,0.06445482014559827,543,I don't want to talk about it.
1575,4,11,62,77,1.2467532467532467,0.06174674356063795,543,What - you'd prefer a donkey in the room?
1575,5,9,63,77,1.2467532467532467,0.06445482014559827,543,Can we please talk about something else?

1575,5,9,63,77,1.2467532467532467,0.06445482014559827,543,"Yes, this is the rescue animal, Fluffy, I spoke of...."
1575,5,9,63,77,1.2467532467532467,0.06445482014559827,543,We should tell him that Trump is gone forever now so he can go outside again.
1575,4,11,62,77,1.2467532467532467,0.06174674356063795,543,Last night I heard her talking about the people in the room.
1575,5,9,63,77,1.2467532467532467,0.06445482014559827,543,You never want to talk about it.
1575,2,15,60,77,1.2467532467532467,0.0559386569469335,543,He's pouting because no one will address the elephant in the room.
1575,2,15,60,77,1.2467532467532467,0.0559386569469335,543,Why does it insist on ignoring us?
1575,5,9,63,77,1.2467532467532467,0.06445482014559827,543,So what did you want to talk about?
1575,6,7,64,77,1.2467532467532467,0.06705361541080136,543,Go see how he filled the other room.
1575,3,13,61,77,1.2467532467532467,0.05891431779020231,543,Just paint the walls gray and maybe he'll blend in.
1714,3,13,62,78,1.2435897435897436,0.05824008274428433,543,"We've been ignoring it for years, Mort. It just won't go away!"

1714,1,17,60,78,1.2435897435897436,0.05221021520794967,543,What's that expression for an obvious thing that nobody talks about?
1714,2,15,61,78,1.2435897435897436,0.055307385628510335,543,Then what ELSE shall we talk about?
1714,4,11,63,78,1.2435897435897436,0.06103202086660262,543,"But on the other hand, the flowers in the meadow should be rather spectacular this summer."
1719,5,9,66,80,1.2375,0.06224632061720393,543,"Honey, I feel like there's something you're forgetting to tell me."

1721,3,12,61,76,1.236842105263158,0.05884389414473132,543,Can we at least talk about the air quality?
1721,4,10,62,76,1.236842105263158,0.06175338914665981,543,"A typical politician, the public face a blowhard and the other end-full of crap!"
1721,4,10,62,76,1.236842105263158,0.06175338914665981,543,"The rug in the room, is it Indian or African?"
1721,3,12,61,76,1.236842105263158,0.05884389414473132,543,Keep reading if you must. But it's in the room....
1721,4,10,62,76,1.236842105263158,0.06175338914665981,543,No more house-sitting for the Ringleys.
1721,3,12,61,76,1.236842105263158,0.05884389414473132,543,Don't get mad at.him. He forgets where the box is.
1721,4,10,62,76,1.236842105263158,0.06175338914665981,543,Is there something you'd like to talk about?
1721,4,10,62,76,1.236842105263158,0.06175338914665981,543,"John, we need to talk about the metaphor in the room."
1721,4,10,62,76,1.236842105263158,0.06175338914665981,543,I like the ones who weren't captured.
1721,4,10,62,76,1.236842105263158,0.06175338914665981,543,"No, you bring it up."
1721,3,12,61,76,1.236842105263158,0.05884389414473132,543,"Politics today is devoid of decency, civility, serious policy discussion, and subtle, non-literal figures of speech."
1721,3,12,61,76,1.236842105263158,0.05884389414473132,543,"If you would only address it, we would have so much more space."
1721,3,12,61,76,1.236842105263158,0.05884389414473132,543,So are we just not going to talk about your plans to vote Republican in the next election?
1721,2,14,60,76,1.236842105263158,0.05578285296696368,543,I have this feeling the end is near
1721,5,8,63,76,1.236842105263158,0.06453183914999833,543,"No, I wanted the matching couch and loveseat, you're the one that insisted on the metaphorical idiom."
1721,2,14,60,76,1.236842105263158,0.05578285296696368,543,Who knew you'd receive such a grand retirement bonus from the zoo?

1721,3,12,61,76,1.236842105263158,0.05884389414473132,543,We acknowledged. Now what?
1721,4,10,62,76,1.236842105263158,0.06175338914665981,543,Looks like the 400 lb. gorilla called in sick again.
1721,4,10,62,76,1.236842105263158,0.06175338914665981,543,I'm looking forward to him moving out Nov. 9th...

1721,3,12,61,76,1.236842105263158,0.05884389414473132,543,They said it was just until they got their party back together.
1721,3,12,61,76,1.236842105263158,0.05884389414473132,543,I don't want to talk about the elephant in the room. I want to talk about what's wrong with our marriage.
1721,2,14,60,76,1.236842105263158,0.05578285296696368,543,Bubbles needs a bathroom break Walt.

1721,4,10,62,76,1.236842105263158,0.06175338914665981,543,"Still think I misused the word ""literally"" for dramatic effect?"
1721,4,10,62,76,1.236842105263158,0.06175338914665981,543,I have a hard time visualizing Trump's base.

1907,3,12,63,78,1.2307692307692308,0.05748380571754565,543,He's hiding here until the post-election stuff blows over.
1907,3,12,63,78,1.2307692307692308,0.05748380571754565,543,Just ignore him.
1907,5,8,65,78,1.2307692307692308,0.0630110195582741,543,"Nancy, I told you, when my circus takes off we'll buy a bigger place."

1917,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,543,The fact that we prefer not to see you twerk doesn't mean we don't love you.
1917,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,543,Why couldn't you just get curtains?
1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,Of course you don't see it.
1917,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,543,I still say our relationship needs more space.

1917,5,7,63,75,1.2266666666666666,0.0645799548665882,543,"I'm not going to state the obvious, but christ, what an a**hole"
1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,Isn't your turn to take him out for a walk?
1917,5,7,63,75,1.2266666666666666,0.0645799548665882,543,I'm not being figurative. Look up.
1917,5,7,63,75,1.2266666666666666,0.0645799548665882,543,"You can keep on ignoring it, but I still think it's a problem we have to discuss."

1917,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,543,Should we talk about who's coming for Thanksgiving?
1917,6,5,64,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06731219006191175,543,Really? That wasn't you?!
1917,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,543,I wish we could talk about the mouse in the room instead.
1917,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,543,The elephant in the room is the elephant in the room.

1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,He won't go out. He's afraid he'll run into a nasty woman.
1917,1,15,59,75,1.2266666666666666,0.052241067457787733,543,Are you going to say something or shall I?
1917,1,15,59,75,1.2266666666666666,0.052241067457787733,543,Our therapist said we're supposed to talk to it.
1917,5,7,63,75,1.2266666666666666,0.0645799548665882,543,"I'm just saying, I do not think probosciuity should not hinder anyone from becoming president."
1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,"Now do you want to talk?"""
1917,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,543,I don't know what you're talking about.
1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,"Oh, now is never a good time for you."
1917,5,7,63,75,1.2266666666666666,0.0645799548665882,543,Can't you at least acknowledge the elephant in the room?
1917,5,7,63,75,1.2266666666666666,0.0645799548665882,543,Relax! If he's not house trained I'll take him back to SPCA
1917,1,15,59,75,1.2266666666666666,0.052241067457787733,543,Must you always be so literal when we argue?
1917,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,543,Oh Yeah!? Then you clean his litter box.
1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,Nobody puts Baby in a corner.
1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,But you promised; no more rescue animals.
1917,5,7,63,75,1.2266666666666666,0.0645799548665882,543,"Sorry, but he wouldn't fit in the basket with the other deplorables."
1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,"Luckily, ""into the lion's den"" wasn't a metaphor that Tom was familiar with."
1917,1,15,59,75,1.2266666666666666,0.052241067457787733,543,"Ok, so you're not speaking ,metaphorically."

1917,5,7,63,75,1.2266666666666666,0.0645799548665882,543,I don't want to talk about it.
1917,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,543,Nothing we've talked about can leave this room.
1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,"No, it's YOUR turn to walk him."
1917,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,543,"I've had enough, we are getting a mouse!"
1917,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,543,Must you always bring up the obvious.
1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,They were out of Gorillas
1917,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,543,I would prefer a donkey in the room.
1917,1,15,59,75,1.2266666666666666,0.052241067457787733,543,"Well, he's definitely not getting a good review on Airbnb."
1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,"Fine. Finish the paper before walking him. But if he has another accident, you’re cleaning it up."
1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,And then there's the smell. You can't pretend you don't smell that.
1917,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,543,You know...hon...today's my birthday...
1917,6,5,64,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06731219006191175,543,"I don't know what to tell you, Stew, the Health Department wouldn't sign off on the donkey."
1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,We just never talk about it.
1917,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,543,What will it take to get your attention?
1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,"Honey, we have to quit the party."
1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,We need to talk about what happened to the gorilla.

1917,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,543,This editorial really brings the metaphor to life
1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,It does take the fun out of being a Republican.
1917,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,543,"If you don't want to talk about it, fine. I just don't want us to be accused of having started some metaphorical idiom."
1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,Couldn't we talk about something else for a change?
1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,"I know he's a symbol and I appreciate all the trouble you've gone to but I cannot, will not vote for that man!"
1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,I think there's bigger things in the room to talk about if that tail goes up!
1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,No big news?
1917,5,7,63,75,1.2266666666666666,0.0645799548665882,543,"Surely, this isn't what they meant by ""Adopt-an-Elephant!"""
1917,5,7,63,75,1.2266666666666666,0.0645799548665882,543,just another big ass republican taking over the room
1917,5,7,63,75,1.2266666666666666,0.0645799548665882,543,The room just seems smaller since we traded in the couch.
1917,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,543,He didn't like the verbally abusive ringmaster.
1917,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,543,"Just a reminder.....measure twice, adopt once."

1917,5,7,63,75,1.2266666666666666,0.0645799548665882,543,"Oh, look! The paper says the Circus is in town!"
1917,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,543,I think he ignores us on purpose.
1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,Thanks for letting me stop by. It's a jungle out there this time of year
1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,Sometimes I feel like our marriage is one big clichè.
1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,What about the no pet clause?
1917,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,543,You are taking your loyalty to the Republican Party too far!
1917,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,543,"I wanted a bird in the hand, but you said, 'let's think big!'"
1917,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,543,It's your birthday wish from 1982.

1917,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,543,Let's agree to ignore this.
1917,5,7,63,75,1.2266666666666666,0.0645799548665882,543,So when is your mother coming to visit?
1917,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,543,"You want to keep that thing, you go hire Mike Pence to clean up behind it!"
1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,You've referred to it many times. Now it's here. So what. .
1917,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,543,How many times do I have to tell you that it is bigger than both of us!
1917,5,7,63,75,1.2266666666666666,0.0645799548665882,543,"Look, the deal we made when Mittens was alive is still in force: I buy the litter and you clean out the box."
1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,Let's not talk about it.
1917,5,7,63,75,1.2266666666666666,0.0645799548665882,543,She is not! Mama's just big boned.
1917,1,15,59,75,1.2266666666666666,0.052241067457787733,543,"Honest to God, I'm sick of it! Can't we discuss something else in the room?"
1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,"""Elephant? What elephant?"

1917,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,543,He reminds me of an older you.
1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,Again...blocking my light.
1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,"No, it's your turn to change the litter box."
1917,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,543,I thought this would help mask the metaphorical version.
1917,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,543,I don't have any idea what you're talking about.
1917,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,543,Nothing to talk about?
1917,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,543,"Sydney, don't worry, he's only staying till the 9th."
1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,"Well, are we going to address the elephant in the room?"
1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,I'm praying that he's house broken!
1917,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,543,Can we please talk about something *besides* the elephant in the room?
1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,"And as head of the Auburn Alumni Committee, you thought stealing their mascot was a good idea? I mean, if it were a cat or a duck i might be on board, but this!"
1917,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,543,It's just until after the election.
1917,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,543,We used to be able to talk about anything.
1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,You know he doesn't like it when you talk about the size of his ears.
1917,1,15,59,75,1.2266666666666666,0.052241067457787733,543,"When you say that we can't keep ignoring him, you're referring to the elephant right?"
1917,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,543,"Good idea, but do they make the kind of litter boxes we're gonna need?"
1917,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,543,And they delivered it in less than an hour!
1917,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,543,Isn't it obvious?
1917,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,543,"Ok, Honey, what's bothering you?"
1917,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,543,"Honey, can you tickle the ivory one more time?"
1917,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,543,What's that smell?
1917,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,543,We'll tell him he's adopted next year.
1917,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,543,"I don't care if his name is idiom, metaphor or cliche, I want him out of my house!"
2064,5,7,64,76,1.2236842105263157,0.06379430819500599,543,"Keep quiet dear, he doesn't know he is here."
2064,4,9,63,76,1.2236842105263157,0.06098226434871825,543,"Well, Gary, we might as well address it now. Is he up to date on his shots?"
2064,4,9,63,76,1.2236842105263157,0.06098226434871825,543,The vet called. He says it's going to be quintuplets.
2064,2,13,61,76,1.2236842105263157,0.05492797264720445,543,You can call it a cliché if you want but I still think we have to discuss it.
2064,3,11,62,76,1.2236842105263157,0.058034122480782775,543,I think the landlord's getting suspicious.
2064,5,7,64,76,1.2236842105263157,0.06379430819500599,543,"Honey, I don't want to adopt again. There. I said it."
2064,2,13,61,76,1.2236842105263157,0.05492797264720445,543,I think it's time we talked about you know what
2064,5,7,64,76,1.2236842105263157,0.06379430819500599,543,'Do you think ears are for show? I CAN HEAR YOU!'
2064,1,15,60,76,1.2236842105263157,0.0516353075535489,543,It's your turn to clean up.
2064,3,11,62,76,1.2236842105263157,0.058034122480782775,543,We need to talk about the elephant in the room -- I hate this rug.
2064,7,3,66,76,1.2236842105263157,0.06907581446529835,543,"honey, no offense but i just bathed the elephant, so i know its not her.....but you smell"

2275,5,5,62,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06541519016903742,543,He's on loan from the RNC. Can we keep him?
2275,1,13,58,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05209800262902861,543,"I'm pretty sure he's talking about us, too."
2275,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,543,"Don't look so surprised, dear. We need to talk."
2275,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,543,He wants to go out.
2275,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,543,I can't wait till this election is finally over and it will be the three of us again!
2275,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,543,That's not the end of the election process I'd like to discuss.
2275,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,543,You get her leash and I'll follow behind in the front end loader.
2275,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,543,"Well, you'd think he would remember the way out."
2275,5,5,62,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06541519016903742,543,Morton has always been very concrete with his metaphors.
2275,1,13,58,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05209800262902861,543,"John, do I need to tell you this relationship isn't working?"
2275,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,543,Are you going to continue to pretend that it's not there?
2275,1,13,58,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05209800262902861,543,She always ignores the people in the room.
2275,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,543,Let's not talk politics tonight.
2275,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,543,He absolutely denies ever being in a room.
2275,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,543,I remember when he was a cute baby elephant.
2275,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,543,It's your turn to clean the litter box.
2275,0,15,57,72,1.2083333333333333,0.048197153144195225,543,Would you have preferred the 800 lb. gorilla?
2275,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,543,I'll be glad when this election's over.
2275,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,543,I felt sorry for him. He said his life was a circus.
2275,1,13,58,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05209800262902861,543,All we ever talk about is the elephant in the room.
2275,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,543,That Really Tied the Room Together
2275,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,543,"Sure, we have some problems but I never thought it was a big deal."
2275,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,543,"No, why do you ask?"
2275,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,543,But we're independents. Is this supposed to help us decide?
2275,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,543,"If you had registered as a democrat like I asked,we wouldn't have this problem!"
2275,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,543,"It's time I told you, Clyde; Jumbo is not really your son."
2275,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,543,He was on sale from Ringling Brothers.
2275,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,543,"Well, it's better than a skeleton in the closet."
2275,1,13,58,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05209800262902861,543,"I don't care if he did follow you home, you can't keep him."
2275,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,543,"I thought you said it was just an expression!"" "" I thought you said it was just an expression!"
2275,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,543,"I know you don't want to talk about it, but ..."
2275,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,543,NOW will you talk about the elephant in the room?
2275,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,543,You're more than a little behind.
2275,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,543,The elephant in the room is the elephant in the room.
2275,5,5,62,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06541519016903742,543,"As a woman, I really feel the GOP candidate is violating my personal space"
2275,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,543,I'd rather not discuss it.
2275,1,13,58,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05209800262902861,543,"I don't care if he is endangered. This isn't an ark, and you aren't Noah."
2275,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,543,"Guess what?"" ""Elephant butt!"
2275,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,543,"No, I don't think he got in through the pet door."
2275,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,543,And nearby hangs a tail.
2275,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,543,"We have acknowledged the elephant in the room, now, the question is who is taking him out for a walk"
2275,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,543,"But Frank, there must be a more efficient way to prevent poaching."
2275,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,543,We know it's a circus but this is ridiculous.
2275,5,5,62,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06541519016903742,543,A Trumpet could mean a bowel movement. Let's get out of here.
2275,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,543,"But dear, I got him for you. You said you are dung hoe about gardening."
2275,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,543,He promises to leave on Wednesday.
2275,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,543,Do you have to be so subtle about my mom coming to stay for a month?
2275,5,5,62,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06541519016903742,543,"No, he can't sit anywhere he wants. He isn't an 800 pound gorilla"
2275,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,543,I feel we really need to talk about something but I can't remember what it is.
2275,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,543,"No,really,we have to talk about it."
2275,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,543,"It's just a saying, you know."
2275,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,543,I thought we agreed not to talk politics!
2275,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,543,"No, I'm pretty sure we've covered everything."
2275,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,543,I've told you three times--*nothing's* the matter.
2275,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,543,Out of the room November 8.
2275,5,5,62,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06541519016903742,543,I say we put a big sectional sofa in here! That way we can both stretch out. They can deliver it Tuesday the 8th which is perfect because there is nothing important going on.
2275,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,543,I had to give her a time out.
2275,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,543,Is there something you're not telling me?
2457,4,7,62,73,1.2054794520547945,0.06155921809457883,543,When are we going to discuss the ass in the room?
2457,3,9,61,73,1.2054794520547945,0.05838681211207499,543,He's just waiting to be acknowledged.
2457,1,13,59,73,1.2054794520547945,0.051458573833719844,543,"Well, I'll give you a hint: It's not the lamp in the room that we should probably talk about."
2457,1,13,59,73,1.2054794520547945,0.051458573833719844,543,Your turn to take him out. DON'T FORGET THE SHOVEL!
2457,3,9,61,73,1.2054794520547945,0.05838681211207499,543,"Ignore it all you want, but it won't be gone unti November 9th."
2462,3,8,60,71,1.1971830985915493,0.05889566640314108,543,"No, you get the shovel."
2462,1,12,58,71,1.1971830985915493,0.051612697538755165,543,"I wonder if he knows, that we know he's in here..."
2462,2,10,59,71,1.1971830985915493,0.05537404657552627,543,"OK, fine. If I agree to talk about the elephant in the room, will he finally go away?"
2462,4,6,61,71,1.1971830985915493,0.06221827712169158,543,"You know that any caption contest entry about 'the elephant in the room' doesn't stand a chance, right?"
2462,1,12,58,71,1.1971830985915493,0.051612697538755165,543,"Really, Do you have to be so literal?"
2462,3,8,60,71,1.1971830985915493,0.05889566640314108,543,What elephant? It's just a mirage of Trump pretending not to be a donkey.
2462,1,12,58,71,1.1971830985915493,0.051612697538755165,543,Where's the donkey?
2462,1,12,58,71,1.1971830985915493,0.051612697538755165,543,"Honey, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about."
2462,3,8,60,71,1.1971830985915493,0.05889566640314108,543,"Oh, don't mention it."
2462,1,12,58,71,1.1971830985915493,0.051612697538755165,543,"Let me guess, there is an elephant in the room."
2462,2,10,59,71,1.1971830985915493,0.05537404657552627,543,Do you expect me to cook for both of you?
2462,3,8,60,71,1.1971830985915493,0.05889566640314108,543,Well you have to admit that the room seems a lot bigger since we got rid of the 800-pound gorilla
2462,4,6,61,71,1.1971830985915493,0.06221827712169158,543,"Is this the new elephant in the room, or the old one?"
2462,3,8,60,71,1.1971830985915493,0.05889566640314108,543,I try not to think about it.
2462,4,6,61,71,1.1971830985915493,0.06221827712169158,543,"If you think Trump's a problem, consider this: the maid just quit."
2462,2,10,59,71,1.1971830985915493,0.05537404657552627,543,I swear I hear the kitchen faucet dripping again.
2462,4,6,61,71,1.1971830985915493,0.06221827712169158,543,"He looked cold, so I let him in."
2462,3,8,60,71,1.1971830985915493,0.05889566640314108,543,"No more excuses, we need a high volume toilet!"
2462,1,12,58,71,1.1971830985915493,0.051612697538755165,543,Is there? I hadn't noticed.
2462,1,12,58,71,1.1971830985915493,0.051612697538755165,543,"I don't know about you, but I plan on ignoring it."
2462,3,8,60,71,1.1971830985915493,0.05889566640314108,543,"It's just until the election's over, and then we'll let him free."
2462,3,8,60,71,1.1971830985915493,0.05889566640314108,543,"5 letters across, starts with T: Makes loud noises and habitually hurls mud."
2462,5,4,62,71,1.1971830985915493,0.06537223030395352,543,We'd be better off just getting him stuffed.
2462,3,8,60,71,1.1971830985915493,0.05889566640314108,543,Can we stop talking about him?
2462,6,2,63,71,1.1971830985915493,0.06838086707431157,543,It is time we talked about the elephant in the room
2462,2,10,59,71,1.1971830985915493,0.05537404657552627,543,What do you mean you don't want to talk about it?
2462,2,10,59,71,1.1971830985915493,0.05537404657552627,543,That's not the grey I had in mind.
2462,3,8,60,71,1.1971830985915493,0.05889566640314108,543,"""Honey, what are your plans with the Trump piñata? You have two more weeks, max"
2462,1,12,58,71,1.1971830985915493,0.051612697538755165,543,It's not funny anymore.
2462,3,8,60,71,1.1971830985915493,0.05889566640314108,543,Next time I want vaulted ceilings.
2462,2,10,59,71,1.1971830985915493,0.05537404657552627,543,Can we talk about the elephant in the room?
2462,0,14,57,71,1.1971830985915493,0.04755476905953276,543,How much longer are we going to go before we address that godawful rug?
2462,3,8,60,71,1.1971830985915493,0.05889566640314108,543,Why did you think that naming it would help?
2462,3,8,60,71,1.1971830985915493,0.05889566640314108,543,"Is it me, or is there something we should be talking about?"
2462,3,8,60,71,1.1971830985915493,0.05889566640314108,543,"I don't know where the Republican Party goes after Trump, but it isn't here."
2462,2,10,59,71,1.1971830985915493,0.05537404657552627,543,Is this our therapist's idea of a joke?
2462,2,10,59,71,1.1971830985915493,0.05537404657552627,543,I thought you said you'd closed the door.
2462,3,8,60,71,1.1971830985915493,0.05889566640314108,543,"But Marty, it was the last one left at the Barney's trunk sale!"
2462,2,10,59,71,1.1971830985915493,0.05537404657552627,543,I don't want to talk about it.
2462,3,8,60,71,1.1971830985915493,0.05889566640314108,543,It is Donald Trump's favorite pet peeve.
2462,3,8,60,71,1.1971830985915493,0.05889566640314108,543,I think it's time for us to clear the air now.
2462,1,12,58,71,1.1971830985915493,0.051612697538755165,543,"Darn, what's that phrase again for the obvious problem that everyone is ignoring?"

3246,2,7,57,66,1.1666666666666667,0.05539993744719456,543,Why won't the elephant in the room address us?
3246,1,9,56,66,1.1666666666666667,0.05101913957479687,543,He followed me from the polling place.

3246,3,5,58,66,1.1666666666666667,0.05945883900105632,543,"Not what I had in mind, hon, when I said I wanted someone in this house to make some big s*#@ happen already."

3246,1,9,56,66,1.1666666666666667,0.05101913957479687,543,"Yes Dumbo, I know he is ignoring me!"
3246,4,3,59,66,1.1666666666666667,0.06325783747136794,543,I think it's time we had a talk about the elephant in the room.
3246,2,7,57,66,1.1666666666666667,0.05539993744719456,543,Guess that's the Elephant in the room.
3246,4,3,59,66,1.1666666666666667,0.06325783747136794,543,"I have thrown away all my china plates, but what have you done about this?"

3246,3,5,58,66,1.1666666666666667,0.05945883900105632,543,"And when, exactly, is it time we address the wife in the room?"
3246,3,5,58,66,1.1666666666666667,0.05945883900105632,543,No question about your party loyalty!

3246,2,7,57,66,1.1666666666666667,0.05539993744719456,543,Dennis says he can't go on until we address the 170-pound you in the room.
3246,3,5,58,66,1.1666666666666667,0.05945883900105632,543,I'm thinking of buying some new curtains.
3246,2,7,57,66,1.1666666666666667,0.05539993744719456,543,"Now that we're talking, let's circle back to the elephant."
3246,2,7,57,66,1.1666666666666667,0.05539993744719456,543,Don't even think about letting that cat out the bag too.
3246,2,7,57,66,1.1666666666666667,0.05539993744719456,543,You and your rescue animals!
3246,2,7,57,66,1.1666666666666667,0.05539993744719456,543,We don't have room for any more issues.
3246,2,7,57,66,1.1666666666666667,0.05539993744719456,543,I'd rather not address it.
3246,2,7,57,66,1.1666666666666667,0.05539993744719456,543,It's time we talk about the elephant in the room.
3246,2,7,57,66,1.1666666666666667,0.05539993744719456,543,He was my emotional support elephant for the election.
3246,2,7,57,66,1.1666666666666667,0.05539993744719456,543,"If things do't go his way way, we could be looking at a big mess."
3246,2,7,57,66,1.1666666666666667,0.05539993744719456,543,Just ignore him.
3246,2,7,57,66,1.1666666666666667,0.05539993744719456,543,Stop trying to influence my vote.
3246,3,5,58,66,1.1666666666666667,0.05945883900105632,543,I warned you not to vote for Trump!
3246,1,9,56,66,1.1666666666666667,0.05101913957479687,543,I misread pachyderm on your profile as patchy-derm. I thought you just had a skin condition.
3246,2,7,57,66,1.1666666666666667,0.05539993744719456,543,Did I tell you I changed my party affiliation?
3246,3,5,58,66,1.1666666666666667,0.05945883900105632,543,Can we just talk about the fact that there's an elephant in the room?
3246,3,5,58,66,1.1666666666666667,0.05945883900105632,543,The cat complained that he made a grab for her again this morning.
3246,0,11,55,66,1.1666666666666667,0.04622501635210244,543,What's a 9 letter word for pachyderm?
3246,1,9,56,66,1.1666666666666667,0.05101913957479687,543,What do you mean you're having an affair? I was asking if you wanted to put Tiny to bed.
3246,2,7,57,66,1.1666666666666667,0.05539993744719456,543,He seemed so appealing on TV. . . .
3246,1,9,56,66,1.1666666666666667,0.05101913957479687,543,"The ""Elephant in the Room"" is the Elephant in the room."
3246,0,11,55,66,1.1666666666666667,0.04622501635210244,543,Maybe we could turn him around slowly!

3246,1,9,56,66,1.1666666666666667,0.05101913957479687,543,"Maybe, three bags of peanuts was too much!"
3246,2,7,57,66,1.1666666666666667,0.05539993744719456,543,Notice how we keep ignoring the fact that we've got an elephant that can't remember that we have a carpet that can't fly? We're literally living in a metaphor...
3246,3,5,58,66,1.1666666666666667,0.05945883900105632,543,Can you pass the Travel Section?

3758,0,9,54,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04444078691701821,543,"Sometimes it's a person in the room that's the problem, Gerald, not the elephant."
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,Why must you keep ignoring me!
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,What elephant in the room?
3758,1,7,55,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04986999410368025,543,"Honey, where's the leash?"
3758,1,7,55,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04986999410368025,543,Did you give him his diarrhea medicine?
3758,1,7,55,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04986999410368025,543,She's a real pleasure having around but I'm a little worried about when she grows up.
3758,4,1,58,63,1.1428571428571428,0.06342802710311082,543,This wasn't the type of erotic statue I had in mind...
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,"Don't worry honey, it's only an expression . . ."
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,We need to talk.
3758,0,9,54,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04444078691701821,543,"I see it, but it's your turn to walk it."
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,Now's a good time to talk. He's sleeping.
3758,3,3,57,63,1.1428571428571428,0.05925438255602429,543,"Well yes, it is high time. But I don't want to hurt his feelings."
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,Talk about self-delusion! Trump will never be more than a horse's.
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,"Dear, I think Babar is about to go poo"
3758,3,3,57,63,1.1428571428571428,0.05925438255602429,543,I don't think the wee-wee pads are working.
3758,1,7,55,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04986999410368025,543,"You can't keep bringing your work home with you, Donald."
3758,1,7,55,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04986999410368025,543,One of them's going to win.
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,Who invited the party pooper?
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,Do you know what today is?
3758,3,3,57,63,1.1428571428571428,0.05925438255602429,543,There seems to be an obvious truth we're not addressing here
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,They said this would help us talk about the divorce.
3758,1,7,55,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04986999410368025,543,It looks like we'll have to wait another four years.
3758,1,7,55,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04986999410368025,543,It's your pet. You clean up.
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,Do you think it's time for his walk?
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,This wasn't what I meant by Safari.
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,"Dear, I think we can no longer pretend not to notice the Republican in the room."
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,It's just that she has an acute case of Scopophobia.
3758,3,3,57,63,1.1428571428571428,0.05925438255602429,543,Stop ignoring Steve.
3758,1,7,55,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04986999410368025,543,It's a law and odor issue.
3758,0,9,54,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04444078691701821,543,This is not what I meant by living in an ivory tower!
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,"At couples therapy this week, can we PLEASE discuss the elephant in the living room?"
3758,0,9,54,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04444078691701821,543,Don't worry - He's house-trained....
3758,3,3,57,63,1.1428571428571428,0.05925438255602429,543,"Yes I love baby elephants, I'm just saying this one has grown a lot."
3758,1,7,55,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04986999410368025,543,He's a great distraction until our furniture arrives.
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,He says he thought he wanted to be in the room where it happens but now he just wants to start a TV network. Maybe you can show him out. He doesn't seem to listen to women.
3758,0,9,54,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04444078691701821,543,The donkey wouldn't have blocked the natural light.
3758,1,7,55,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04986999410368025,543,"Just ignore it, and it will go away!"
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,Why can't we talk about it?
3758,1,7,55,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04986999410368025,543,"He prefers if we use the term """"800-pound gorilla""."
3758,3,3,57,63,1.1428571428571428,0.05925438255602429,543,I'm fine. I'm just wondering if you asked whether he's house trained?
3758,0,9,54,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04444078691701821,543,"This thing is house-trained, right?"
3758,3,3,57,63,1.1428571428571428,0.05925438255602429,543,It's only a matter of time until you're outed as the ringleader.
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,Stop arm-chair speculating in ivory. It is your turn to walk Horton.
3758,1,7,55,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04986999410368025,543,"Still not going to talk about it, eh?"
3758,0,9,54,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04444078691701821,543,You seem to be spending a lot of time with your decorator-friend Paul. Is there something you’re not telling me?
3758,0,9,54,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04444078691701821,543,Let's talk about your candidate.
3758,1,7,55,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04986999410368025,543,"The elephant in the room, which we are not discussing, is now taking up 3/4 of our living room. What do you suggest we do now?"
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,"Of course, I'm just the human in the room."
3758,0,9,54,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04444078691701821,543,It's safe to ignore him. He just remembered something.
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,I'd be more selective in choice of topics!
3758,1,7,55,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04986999410368025,543,Now you can talk about it.
3758,4,1,58,63,1.1428571428571428,0.06342802710311082,543,The awkward issue no one's talking about in this election is that the GOP leadership is holed up in our living room.
3758,1,7,55,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04986999410368025,543,Roll up the rug.
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,Does he do any tricks?
3758,3,3,57,63,1.1428571428571428,0.05925438255602429,543,Woaooo...sounds like an elephant fart!
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,Are you sure we can crate train him?
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,"I'm sorry!"" We just cannot ignore it anymore."
3758,0,9,54,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04444078691701821,543,You always find a way to avoid my questions about your wife.

3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,Why do you keep bringing up the elephant in the room if you won't talk about it?
3758,0,9,54,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04444078691701821,543,Could we go back to the 800-pound gorilla?
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,He's here until the suspense of any recount is over
3758,1,7,55,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04986999410368025,543,I can actually ignore him but I'll never get used to the poop.
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,"Hey, can we talk about the size of the room for the elephant?"
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,"Honey, did you get the measurements for the couch?"
3758,1,7,55,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04986999410368025,543,You probably don't want to talk about it but there's an elephant in the room.
3758,0,9,54,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04444078691701821,543,It's your turn to take him for a walk - I took him this morning.
3758,0,9,54,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04444078691701821,543,I think my shrink is psychic.
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,"Maybe, just maybe I could get used to the Elephant in the room, however could you speed up with that newspaper, she has to do a solid !"
3758,0,9,54,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04444078691701821,543,Is there something you wanted to talk about?
3758,1,7,55,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04986999410368025,543,"We need to talk about it, the room is getting crowded."
3758,0,9,54,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04444078691701821,543,The organic ivory is growing!
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,The obvious elephant in the room. Again not being addressed.
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,What donkey?
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,"Ok smarty pants, who's gonna clean up the poop?"
3758,3,3,57,63,1.1428571428571428,0.05925438255602429,543,Don't look at him. Just ignore him.
3758,1,7,55,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04986999410368025,543,Mr Trunk feels isolated after his party failed to acknowledged him.
3758,3,3,57,63,1.1428571428571428,0.05925438255602429,543,Are they changing their logo?

3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,The people who use that expression are those poor deprived souls who've never actually owned one.
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,Really? Elephant in the room? Is that supposed to be a joke? You're getting lazy Steve.
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,Your metaphors are too heavy.
3758,1,7,55,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04986999410368025,543,That's not what I meant by the elephant in the room.
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,"Actually, I'd call it the room outside the elephant"
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,I doubt this will make our living room great again....
3758,1,7,55,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04986999410368025,543,Some sun. A few clouds. Does it say anything about elephants?
3758,1,7,55,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04986999410368025,543,Honey is there something you're not telling me?
3758,0,9,54,63,1.1428571428571428,0.04444078691701821,543,Why not talk about the elephant in the room.

3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,This must be a very serious issue.
3758,2,5,56,63,1.1428571428571428,0.054763574408528054,543,Let's talk about the man in the room.

3758,3,3,57,63,1.1428571428571428,0.05925438255602429,543,I told you we should have sent him to Alabama instead of Harvard.

4232,0,8,54,62,1.1290322580645162,0.042922525410265526,543,A few hands of bridge? Where are we going to find a fourth at this hour?
4232,0,8,54,62,1.1290322580645162,0.042922525410265526,543,I think he needs to go for a walk.
4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,I feel like we should address it
4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,Does the elephant go right or left?
4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,"First the giant python in the office, then the whale in the car, and now the elephant in the house -- where will it end, Bob?"
4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,"Sooner or later, one of us is going to have to bring up a yuuuuge issue."
4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,Don’t worry — I stocked up on extra air fresheners.
4232,3,2,57,62,1.1290322580645162,0.05855600205711376,543,"Donald, I think we need to discuss the Elephant in the room."

4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,Thank God the Trump Laxative™ doesn't work.
4232,0,8,54,62,1.1290322580645162,0.042922525410265526,543,He's practicing his concession speech.
4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,Too on the nose?

4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,That offhand remark about how big she's gotten ... did you really consider her feelings?
4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,He’d be tolerable if he wasn’t gluten-free.

4232,0,8,54,62,1.1290322580645162,0.042922525410265526,543,I've had it with your Republican extremism!
4232,0,8,54,62,1.1290322580645162,0.042922525410265526,543,Seriously? I can't imagine there's anything significant we haven't already discussed.
4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,"He's depressed, he wants to watch the Ronnie Raygun marathon again."
4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,When Donald leaves the room he takes all the oxygen with him.
4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,I don't want to talk about it.
4232,0,8,54,62,1.1290322580645162,0.042922525410265526,543,"I know it's endangered, but keeping it is not going to save the Party!"
4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,But it's your turn to walk him!
4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,"Look, he's gluten intolerant. The oats were just NOT a good idea."
4232,0,8,54,62,1.1290322580645162,0.042922525410265526,543,"For so-called limited government, it sure is HUGE, obnoxious, and foul."
4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,"Listen, I don't want to talk about it!"

4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,I told you to get a gorilla
4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,I think the problem between us is that you have a monkey on your back.
4232,0,8,54,62,1.1290322580645162,0.042922525410265526,543,I can't believe you are voting for that person!!!
4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,Elephant? I don't see any elephant.
4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,We need to talk about the elephant dung in the room.
4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,What elephant? What room?
4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,Wait -- you support Trump?
4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,I'll be the one to bring up the elephant in the room.
4232,0,8,54,62,1.1290322580645162,0.042922525410265526,543,"Honey, get the air freshner! No, it's not my imagination, something around here really stinks!"
4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,"From this day forth, we shall call all elephants in the room Trump."

4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,I think I would be remiss if I didn't address this development.
4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,"Next time you bet on the election, make the stakes a little more reasonable."
4232,0,8,54,62,1.1290322580645162,0.042922525410265526,543,I am going to ignore the obvious people in the room.
4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,Can we talk about the elephant in the room? Donald Trump may be President!
4232,0,8,54,62,1.1290322580645162,0.042922525410265526,543,Now can we talk about the elephant in the room?
4232,0,8,54,62,1.1290322580645162,0.042922525410265526,543,"I’m not kidding, there's an elephant in the room."
4232,0,8,54,62,1.1290322580645162,0.042922525410265526,543,They talk as if I am nor even in the same room.
4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,Where are all of our peanuts going to?
4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,"Reince, do you think the ""Trump brand"" will ever recover?"
4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,"All I said was ""It's time to deal with the elephant in the room"""
4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,Remember to bring a shovel and a big bag.
4232,0,8,54,62,1.1290322580645162,0.042922525410265526,543,We absolutely can't downsize until we address the Elephant in the Room.
4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,He came with the rug.
4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,Is this your way of saying we don't need any more furniture?
4232,0,8,54,62,1.1290322580645162,0.042922525410265526,543,I thought you said it would leave once the election was over.
4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,Schrodinger's Elephant is back!

4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,Relax Donald … the elephant isn’t really in the room until Gloria Allred says so!
4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,"So, how do you think we should re-start the Party?"
4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,"Whatever you do, i'm not voting for Trump."
4232,0,8,54,62,1.1290322580645162,0.042922525410265526,543,Why can't you just acknowledge the elephant in the room?
4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,"Endangered species, my ass! He's never gonna' leave."
4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,Do I have to paint it pink before you address it?
4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,"Sooner or later, he'll have to confront the truth about our marriage."

4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,"I know it's ""The Elephant"" in the room ... but there's really an elephant in the room!"
4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,Now about the elephant in the room -- not this one .....
4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,"I thin by talking about it, we made it bigger."
4232,3,2,57,62,1.1290322580645162,0.05855600205711376,543,We cant ingnore it much longer ..
4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,"I know this is your quiet time, but we HAVE to talk about the elephant in the room."
4232,0,8,54,62,1.1290322580645162,0.042922525410265526,543,But isn't it better to actually have the elephant in the room?
4232,3,2,57,62,1.1290322580645162,0.05855600205711376,543,My god Peter. Now he's grabbing pachyderm pussy!!!
4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,"While he's in here, can't we decorate him for Christmas?"
4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,"I've been meaning to ask, what exactly is wrong with ordering takeout? Or do you want to cook?"
4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,It's getting harder to ignore the elephant in the room.
4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,Did I mention we're having company?
4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,"Now that he's grown too big to ignore, I think we should give him a name. Does ""Donald T. Rump"" sound too ridiculous?"
4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,We need to talk...
4232,3,2,57,62,1.1290322580645162,0.05855600205711376,543,"Well then, lets compromise and call him Comey!"
4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,Have you read anything about a lost trump?
4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,"Sure the other apartments were nice, but this is the real DUMBO."
4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,It was speaking metaphorically.
4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,"Hey Corky, Bimbo goes or I go."
4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,I guess there's little left to say.
4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,Are we going to discuss the elephant in the room?
4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,I know you do not want to discuss it but the curbs on our street are overwhelmed.
4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,Those Trump boys will never find him here.
4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,"The inspector from Housing Authority stopped by today and said, ""we have to address the elephant in the room"". He laughed as if it was funny."
4232,0,8,54,62,1.1290322580645162,0.042922525410265526,543,"He wishes he could forget that you didn't walk him yesterday, but he just can't."
4232,0,8,54,62,1.1290322580645162,0.042922525410265526,543,"I really don't feel like talking about it, dear."
4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,Let's discuss the elephant in the room.
4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,"Week after week, you check for your name in the back of that magazine, but your submissions will never be picked for the caption contest!"
4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,Don't try and pretend the whole thing doesn't smell.
4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,It's not that I mind taking him walkies Gerald. I'm just thinking about all the poop bags.
4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,It was easier to ignore when its trump was smaller.
4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,Today? oh not much to speak of.
4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,Judging by this elephant the Republicans are bigger than we thought!
4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,"Harold, your unwillingness to admit your affair is not the elephant in the room. The real issue is...the elephant in the room."
4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,You said you wanted to help. He'll be back on his feet in 4 years or so.
4232,2,4,56,62,1.1290322580645162,0.053851505523430855,543,OK-- YOU MADE YOUR POINT--YOUR VOTING REPUBLICAN.
4232,1,6,55,62,1.1290322580645162,0.048694598441382554,543,"Oh, come on honey, pull my finger."
4232,0,8,54,62,1.1290322580645162,0.042922525410265526,543,This house isn't big enough for the three of us.
4232,0,8,54,62,1.1290322580645162,0.042922525410265526,543,I told you not to bait the mouse traps with peanut butter.

4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"It's not the fact that it's in the room, it's the mess we've got to clean up when it's gone after Tuesday."""
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"I think of you as a zookeeper, dear."
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,We picked the wrong elephant. Can we send him back?
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"To vote for him, do I just pull the tail"
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Nope. Not gonna discuss it. There is nothing to say.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Did you think about the proposition I made you last week about moving to a bigger place?
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,"If we can't talk about sex, it's bound to become one of those; one of those; what did Dostoevsky call it ?"
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,I think we've seen the last of the peanuts I dropped.
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,"You keep bringing it up, Jim. But I don't see what my pet elephant has to do with the fact that we don't make love anymore."
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,OK. I get it. We should talk!
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,I can't ignore it anymore!
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,We were so lucky to find a veterinarian who makes house calls.
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,"OK, let's not talk about the Elephant in the room."
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,It appears to be a new strategy.
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,Is there something you think we should discuss?
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,"Your paper is blocking the light, Dear"
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,Do you really believe in party solidarity or do you just not see the elephant in the room?
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"Even so, it's rude not to offer a lady your chair."
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,You carried your commitment to the Republican Party too far.
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,Should we talk about the 800 pound gorilla on your back?
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"Your turn to walk him, don't forget the 60 gallon garbage bag"
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,So that's what you traded that 800 pound gorilla for! I still think that makes you an ignore-Amos.
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,This has simply gone too far.
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,I don't believe in elephants. Do you?
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,That smell is the other elephant in the room.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"I'm sorry! ""Foster a zoo animal"" seemed like a good idea!"
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Are you still going to take him out for a walk before we go to bed?
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"She said she'd forgive but never forget the snarky ""you're- making -my -life- a- circus"" crack."
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,"Oh no, dear - it's way more than 800 pounds."
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Elephant? What elephant?
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Tell m again why you thought a sign on the front yard was ostentatious.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,What? You're the one who said you wanted to dress an elephant in the room.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,She wants Gloria Allred’s telephone number.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,I find elephants in the room make the best conversation topics.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"Funny smell?"" ""No, I do not smell anything."
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,"Yes, we NEED to discuss this! However, I do not want to use the old cliche about the elephant in the room."
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,He wouldn't get so big if you didn't make hay out of every little thing.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Did one of us forget to buy more litter?
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,Are we just going to ignore the elephant in the room?
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,It's your turn to clean up the you know what from the you know who.
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,Do you think we should start looking for a larger apartment?
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,I have a feeling Ellie needs to go out.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,I distinctly remember calling him a horse's ass.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,I think he got that one......let's switch to blond jokes.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,There's no room for an elephant
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,Can we address the republican in the room?
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,I think we should get a different coffee table.
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,We can't go on like this. Just admit it: you're a poacher.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,I'll give you tons of reasons why not!
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,"Harold, let's talk about the elephant in the room."
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,If it farts once more I will just have to mention it.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,It's feeling so claustrophobic here - don't you think it's time we move to a bigger place?
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,We need either a bigger room or a smaller elephant.
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,He must have heard our conversation about the G.O.P.!
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,"Her ""no starch"" diet isn't going so well I'm afraid."
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,You were oversold.
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,"OK, let's talk about it. It's the flatulence, stupid."
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Shh! Don't say anything. Pretend he's not here and and he will go away.
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,The real elephant in the room is that neither of us are talking about the elephant in the room.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Should we discuss the elephant in the room?
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,He's not yuge. He's an elephant in name only.
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,How do I know what beast Hannibal marched over the Alps?
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,We'll never get this cleaned up.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"Look, he just started retirement. Give him time to adjust."
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,Is he house broke?
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,This address definitely makes her look fat.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,You don't see how he's weighing us down?
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,"Honey, we have to talk about it now -- or we will soon have to talk about something else."
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,Why do you keep talking about an elephant in the room? Are you dellusional?
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Isn't this taking your Republicanism a bit too far?
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Is this the large pachyage you were telling me about?
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,I thought it would be a lot noisier!
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"No, Phyllis, I can't make him sit in the corner."
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,I believe that's a subspecies of Loxodonta africana in the room.
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,"No, I meant literally. But now that you mention it, dual custody is probably best."
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,"Really John, how damn big does a problem have to get before your willing to discuss things?"
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,It must be instinctive. The just seem to know how to use the litter rug.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"Bill, a part of the adoption agreement is that we wouldn't keep him outside."
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,"Sure, you want to invite new neighbors, but Republicans are too inflated."
4533,3,1,56,60,1.1166666666666667,0.05866531842313125,543,"Frank, I think it is time to take Elli back to the zoo."
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,what do you mean you're color blind?
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Let's just get it over with
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,It's only a pet if it wants to be a pet.
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,Can't we just deal with it.
4533,3,1,56,60,1.1166666666666667,0.05866531842313125,543,"I can't say why, but we're going to need a really big shovel."
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"Honey, we can no longer ignore the elephant in the room."
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,Still refusing to address it?
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,"Let's get it over with Frank, there's an extremely large mammal in the room."
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"Okay, I will acknowledge that he is in the room, but are you sure that he is housebroken?"
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,I think we need to talk about it.
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,Is it just me or was it easier with the 800-pound gorilla?
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,"If you took your nose out of the g**damn newspaper, maybe you'd notice the elephant in the room."
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,I don't want to talk about it. Do you want to talk about it? I don't even know what you're talking about.
4533,3,1,56,60,1.1166666666666667,0.05866531842313125,543,"Cute, but I'm really NOT in the mood for your double entendre stunt!"
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,If he raises his tail run for it!
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,You're kidding.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,You never have anything to talk about.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,The Ringling Brothers people said it was a pigmy elephant that would not grow bigger than a St. Bernard.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Look at the trunk on that junk!
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"He just showed up on the porch, lost and hungry. He won't eat or drink. I felt sorry for him. We've got to get him to the animal shelter."
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,Can we keep him?
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,"'If it farts we may actually die! Do you want that on your tombstone?"""
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,I just couldn't find any of those red hats.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,I can't say I'm a fan of the sharing economy
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,"I have avoided it up to now, but there is something troubling me deeply."
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,He' looking for a place he can fit in
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Are you saying I'm fat?
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"That will never do as a coffee table. Also, you're never going to the dump alone again."
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,Why do I always feel as if I'm the elephant in the room?
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"...not to mention something else that has to go after the election, too."
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,Maybe we should agree to disagree...the elephant seems to have had enough.
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,"We can avoid talking about HIM all you want, but you'd better believe we're going to have a conversation about what he did to the front door."
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Do you really expect me to say the obvious line here?
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,The one that isn't in the room is out campaigning.
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,Remind me again of the expression. Is it the 800 lb. gorilla in the room?
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,It's terrifying when she wants tummy rubs.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,so glad it was just locker room bravado!
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"Dear, I've asked you to please not mention the election any more."
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Time to put down the newspaper and deal with the elephant in the room.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"There's something obvious that we've needed to talk about, but just haven't."
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,"I don't care that it is white, what I am worried about is, that it's right here, in our room."
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,"No, it's your turn to take Mr. Snuffleupagus for a walk !"
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,It is time to admit it - he is HERE!
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"We don't have to talk about it, just please tell me you have a really big litter box somewhere."
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,There's an elephant in the room or are you leaving me?
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,"Now, how do we get this elephant out of the room?"
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,Donald set precedent.
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,"Well, he's certainly more than a horse's ass."
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,How do you ignore the elephant in the room?
4533,3,1,56,60,1.1166666666666667,0.05866531842313125,543,It's just like you not to talk about the elephant in the room!
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,"Listen, I'd let you keep him if it weren't for that trunk."
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,I think we need to discuss the elephant in the room.
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,"I am hoping that on Nov 9th he will be able to again go out and, this time, not remember."
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,"""Get a pet!"" you said. ""Get a pet!"" Well...?"
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Why do you keep insisting that we have an elephant in the room?
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,"Now while he's in timeout, let's talk about the elephant in the room"
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,I told you not to complain about the 800 pound gorilla in the room
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,"You know, Mike, for once I think we need to talk about us."
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Why do you always take everything to its magical extreme?
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,They won't let her register as an independent.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Her: Does it say how to deflate it ? Him: I'm looking.
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,where did you get the elephant--what elephant
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"Don't worry, hopefully he'll leave on November 9th."
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,"Harry, there's been something I've been wanted to talk about."
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,"Let's talk about the elephant in the room - you hate this top, don't you."
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,Can we please talk about the elephant in the room?
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Let's not talk about the elephant in the room
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,"No dear, elephants don't bark."
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"No, you walk him tonight. The steam shovel is in the driveway."
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,I'd like to address the elephant in the room
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,It got rid of the black sheep in the family.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Now let's talk about the room in the elephant.
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,How can you not see the Oliphant in the room?
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,That's not what I meant when I said we need to address the elephant in the room.
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,And the elephant is still not the biggest one in the room.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"Its an absolute sign, John. We must vote straight Republican this year."
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,Looks like the 400 lb Gorilla didn't work
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"Dear, I think your perception of my mother is a bit oversized"
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"No, I mean there’s literally an elephant in the room."
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,Elephant in the room? Whatever are you talking about?
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,We should talk about this in the rumpus room.
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,At least there's not two of them.
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,The obvious problem that is going unaddressed is the elephant in the room.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"I get that your point of view is different, but we still need to talk about it."
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,Can't you at least put some newspapers down?
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,How come you never ask me about *my* day?
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Shut up about the elephant in the room. We're all aware of the elephant in the room.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"Frank, you're ignoring the elephant in the room and now it's hungry."
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Didn't you ask for a donkey ?
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,oh fuck
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,The ten day forecast says clear skies and chilly.
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,"When you married me you said you were fine with family staying with us no matter if they were broke, unemployed, or swallowed by an elephant."
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"Henry, I think it's about time we discussed the affair you had while on safari. And... don't even think of trying to sweep it under the rug."
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,"Now we can finally talk, the gorilla has left the room."
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"Fine, but I want to talk about the 800-pound gorilla in the room."
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,"Maybe she did pack her trunk and say goodbye to the circus, but are you sure the rest isn't just locker room talk?"
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,The duck insurance took up less space.
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,"After all he's done, the least Trump could do is house the Party mascot for the next four years."
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,"If something were bothering me, I'd say so."
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,I think we should really address the elephant in the room before continuing
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,We need to talk about Donnie.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"Once he is potty trained, we can move the furniture back in here."
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,The elephant in the room? What elephant in the room?
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,I see nothing in the room.
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,Are you going to address the elephant in the room?
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Ignore the elephant. Just pretend it's not here.
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,"What? ""Dark side of the moon"" is your favorite"
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,Do you get a mahout with this pachyderm?
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,"Yes, I HAVE noticed it in the room."
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Nosy bastard.
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,He's hurting. Somebody said he's fat and ugly.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Smaller portions?
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,"It's time, Harold, that we talked about the only real elephant in the room."
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,There is an elephant in the room.
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,Is there something you want to tell me?
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,We'll get to that after we discuss your second family.
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,It's time we kicked him out of the nest.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,One should think about the future when buying a pet! Living in the moment does not aleways work!
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,We should've gone to Europe.
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,What's that funny smell?
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,"Honey, we literally need to address the elephant in the room!"
4533,3,1,56,60,1.1166666666666667,0.05866531842313125,543,I think things are really getting better between us....but I think the apartment is feeling small.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Will you please acknowledge him so he can leave?
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"You picked him, you clean up after him."
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,Why can't he stay with the Trumps?
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,"Agreed, but how else can we get rid of all the peanuts?"
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,"No, he can't go out until after the election. People will think we're voting for...shhh...you know who!"
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,The chastity belt has upped its ante.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,I just feel like we could use more space.
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,I just can't understand why we keep running out of peanuts.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Should we try an open concept?
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Are we actually REQUIRED to have an elephant in the room?
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"I understand the saying,but there is a REAL elephant in the room."
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,I told you it would backfire.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Do you really want to talk about the Republican Party right now?
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Nature calls.
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,Do you think the coffee beans are worth all this?
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Don't you see the elephant in the room?
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,"Elephant or ass in the upcoming election?Decisions, decisions..."
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Let's talk instead about moving the carpet.
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,"In hindsight, maybe we should have bought a bigger house!"
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,How is he looking in his Senate race?
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Don't be fooled by that weather report- I know there's an earthquake coming
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,I wonder if we can afford to continue to be part of the Save The Elephants movement.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"Well, maybe this is just the big end of a tired, old metaphor."
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,I was tired of the cliche'!
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,"Of course, this just underscores the 800-pound gorilla in the room."
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,I think it's time we consulted the elephant in the room.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,It's too cliche to ignore him.
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,Can we talk about the Republican in the corner?
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"Dexter, I have a secret to share with you."
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"The GOP delivered him yesterday, just in time for the holidays."
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"No dear, it is your turn to take her for a walk."
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,"It's ok as a metaphors, but...."
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,I know our problems are obvious but you didn't have to fit an actual elephant in the room to make your point
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"And then she said, 'One day, you two are going to have to have the conversation about why your ceilings are so high.'"
4533,0,7,53,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04179359199028118,543,"Honey, if that's what you want to do, don't let anything stand in your way."
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,"He's not here to make you wonder how he got in, he's here to get you to talk about the time you've been spending with that woman from work."
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,I'm glad you're sitting down for this...
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"Call me crazy, but you're going to miss seeing his droppings."
4533,2,3,55,60,1.1166666666666667,0.053634390406482234,543,""" OK BOB . ENOUGH IS ENOUGH . I KNOW YOUR VOTING FOR TRUMP !!"
4533,1,5,54,60,1.1166666666666667,0.04807989270851719,543,"If your going to let it stay in the room, at least have it wipe it's feet."
4787,1,5,55,61,1.1147540983606556,0.04732379255652672,543,We've just got to talk about it.
4787,1,5,55,61,1.1147540983606556,0.04732379255652672,543,"I can take a hint. Mine's too small, and not fully rounded."
4787,1,5,55,61,1.1147540983606556,0.04732379255652672,543,"Stop reading the newspaper and put it under Dumpo, or you’ll have to shampoo the rug again."
4787,1,5,55,61,1.1147540983606556,0.04732379255652672,543,"Okay. Go ahead and vote for Trump, but get rid of the elephant."
4787,2,3,56,61,1.1147540983606556,0.05278247274773007,543,"The way that woman talks, it's like I'm not even in the room."
4787,2,3,56,61,1.1147540983606556,0.05278247274773007,543,The rest is silence.
4787,2,3,56,61,1.1147540983606556,0.05278247274773007,543,"OK! I get the message! It's bigger than both of us!""  ""OK! I get the message. It's bigger than both of us!"
4787,0,7,54,61,1.1147540983606556,0.04114721441970865,543,He thought we’d stopped loving him.
4787,1,5,55,61,1.1147540983606556,0.04732379255652672,543,The elephant in the room is that you're no six hundred pound gorilla.
4787,0,7,54,61,1.1147540983606556,0.04114721441970865,543,So...what do you want to talk about?
4787,1,5,55,61,1.1147540983606556,0.04732379255652672,543,"Look, you've got to walk him. Nobody's going to snicker at you just because the Republican Party is in shambles."
4787,1,5,55,61,1.1147540983606556,0.04732379255652672,543,We can only hope that the next cull will get rid of him.
4787,1,5,55,61,1.1147540983606556,0.04732379255652672,543,...and I don't want to talk about Donald Trump either!
4787,1,5,55,61,1.1147540983606556,0.04732379255652672,543,"Look, I know Jumanji is your favorite movie..."
4787,1,5,55,61,1.1147540983606556,0.04732379255652672,543,I didn't want to mention it but there is literally an elephant in the room.
4787,0,7,54,61,1.1147540983606556,0.04114721441970865,543,Shouldn't we discuss this before Election Day?
4787,1,5,55,61,1.1147540983606556,0.04732379255652672,543,Let's hope in four years we can send him back to Washington.
4787,1,5,55,61,1.1147540983606556,0.04732379255652672,543,"No, I'm not ignoring him."
4787,1,5,55,61,1.1147540983606556,0.04732379255652672,543,"He promised us it would be ""...UGE""!"
4787,2,3,56,61,1.1147540983606556,0.05278247274773007,543,He's hiding from Trump. Let's hope he doesn't shit all over us.
4787,0,7,54,61,1.1147540983606556,0.04114721441970865,543,Maybe it would be fine if we had a bigger apartment.
4787,0,7,54,61,1.1147540983606556,0.04114721441970865,543,I told you we were low on elephant food.
4787,2,3,56,61,1.1147540983606556,0.05278247274773007,543,SO WHEN WERE YOU GOING TO TELL ME YOUR MOTHER WAS COMING TO VISIT!
4787,0,7,54,61,1.1147540983606556,0.04114721441970865,543,I can't recall the expression for this type of situation.
4787,0,7,54,61,1.1147540983606556,0.04114721441970865,543,"Are you sure Fido, here, is a Shar-Pei?"
4787,2,3,56,61,1.1147540983606556,0.05278247274773007,543,Not talking about it doesn't help!
4787,0,7,54,61,1.1147540983606556,0.04114721441970865,543,"Yes darling, it tis a tad stuffy in here."
4787,2,3,56,61,1.1147540983606556,0.05278247274773007,543,"So, you still don't think we should get that expansion?"
4787,1,5,55,61,1.1147540983606556,0.04732379255652672,543,Do you Smell roasted peanuts?
4787,1,5,55,61,1.1147540983606556,0.04732379255652672,543,Are you telling me he's not housebroken yet?
4787,0,7,54,61,1.1147540983606556,0.04114721441970865,543,The new model has over 10 LBs of memory.
4787,1,5,55,61,1.1147540983606556,0.04732379255652672,543,"MYRTLE, THIS IS THE END"
4787,1,5,55,61,1.1147540983606556,0.04732379255652672,543,I guess you're right. He is better off here than with Ringling Brothers.
4787,2,3,56,61,1.1147540983606556,0.05278247274773007,543,"Whatever you do, don't say 'Trump'"
4787,3,1,57,61,1.1147540983606556,0.05772726839888201,543,Don't you like the new gray wallpaper in this room?

4787,1,5,55,61,1.1147540983606556,0.04732379255652672,543,Forget the pooper-scooper and take the dump-truck.
4787,2,3,56,61,1.1147540983606556,0.05278247274773007,543,Let's not talk about the elephant in the room
4787,2,3,56,61,1.1147540983606556,0.05278247274773007,543,"It's like my mother always said, a room isn't a room without one."
4787,1,5,55,61,1.1147540983606556,0.04732379255652672,543,"You asked him in. Now, please, would you kindly ask him to leave?"
4827,1,5,56,62,1.1129032258064515,0.046591027055115,543,I told you this apartment was big enough for an elephant.
4828,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,543,You said he was only going to stay until election day.
4829,1,4,53,58,1.103448275862069,0.04724506633555822,543,"OK, but first let's talk about ... paper clips. Or shoelaces. Or frying pans ..."
4830,1,4,54,59,1.1016949152542372,0.0464704883270233,543,He hates it when we talk about anything that's not in the room.
4830,0,6,53,59,1.1016949152542372,0.03968693424047915,543,"We have an unaired issue between us, and it's time to put words to it."
4830,0,6,53,59,1.1016949152542372,0.03968693424047915,543,Don't you think you should have told me we were having company for dinner?
4830,1,4,54,59,1.1016949152542372,0.0464704883270233,543,We really need to talk about the 800-pound gorilla in the room...
4830,1,4,54,59,1.1016949152542372,0.0464704883270233,543,"I swear, if he has an accident in the house, you won't see a Clinton or a Trump presidency!"

4830,1,4,54,59,1.1016949152542372,0.0464704883270233,543,Friday is the deadline and you haven't mentioned it.
4830,1,4,54,59,1.1016949152542372,0.0464704883270233,543,I think we need to have a serious discussion about the elephant in the room.
4830,0,6,53,59,1.1016949152542372,0.03968693424047915,543,If we recognize that it is here will it go away

4830,0,6,53,59,1.1016949152542372,0.03968693424047915,543,Do you expect to find how to paper train your elephant in the sports section?
4830,0,6,53,59,1.1016949152542372,0.03968693424047915,543,No. I don't notice anything strange. Why do you ask?
4830,0,6,53,59,1.1016949152542372,0.03968693424047915,543,"I Know its a good set up for the joke, But it just takes up too much space."
4830,0,6,53,59,1.1016949152542372,0.03968693424047915,543,How bout we don't talk about the elephant in the room
4830,1,4,54,59,1.1016949152542372,0.0464704883270233,543,This elephant is REALLY in the room.
4830,0,6,53,59,1.1016949152542372,0.03968693424047915,543,"So, if we address it and it disappears, do we get the couch and armchair back?"
4830,1,4,54,59,1.1016949152542372,0.0464704883270233,543,"What do you mean, 'Don't mention it,'?"
4830,1,4,54,59,1.1016949152542372,0.0464704883270233,543,"Why, it's all the rage! Everyone's talking about it."

4830,0,6,53,59,1.1016949152542372,0.03968693424047915,543,"Maybe it's supposed to be a metaphorical idiom, but its literal presence blocks my view of the ghastly painting on the opposite wall."

4830,0,6,53,59,1.1016949152542372,0.03968693424047915,543,"Pay no attention, she will go away"
4830,1,4,54,59,1.1016949152542372,0.0464704883270233,543,That tight feeling you get at the tail end of election season.
