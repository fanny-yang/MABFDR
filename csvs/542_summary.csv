1601,4,14,82,100,1.22,0.05041244034376972,542,I once actually saw her neck. I almost lost my mind.

4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,Her ruff is worse than her bite!
4287,0,9,71,80,1.1125,0.0355505968544673,542,Must be rich.
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,It's the new government requirement to prevent whiplash.
4287,0,9,71,80,1.1125,0.0355505968544673,542,"Not for fashion, personal safety. She had her footman measure, and it definitely won't fit in the guillotine."
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,They say she's had it rough.
4287,2,5,73,80,1.1125,0.04355176608490089,542,"If she dies, no autopsy required."
4287,2,5,73,80,1.1125,0.04355176608490089,542,How tragic for Lady Collagen.
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,She picked it up in Henry VIII's estate auction.
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,I think that limits how nasty she can be.
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,It prevents arguments
4287,2,5,73,80,1.1125,0.04355176608490089,542,"I heard she's auditioning to be the pharmacist on ""Doc Martin""."

4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,Poor Beata: she’ll never ‘stoop to collar’ a man.
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,I told you those collars would come back into fashion.

4287,3,3,74,80,1.1125,0.04704478744044291,542,She said she had a dream about the future. Somehow protects against unwanted kissing
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,Me thinks she hath no hankerchief to drop.
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,"That's what I love about this village, man. I get older and the girls in the huge collars stay the same age."
4287,3,3,74,80,1.1125,0.04704478744044291,542,It is the new chastity belt all the kids are using.
4287,3,3,74,80,1.1125,0.04704478744044291,542,With that oblivion collar she won't even see the guillotine coming.
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,"What do you think of the new facial, chastity belts?” “Well one thinks it will be the end of the pearl necklace."
4287,2,5,73,80,1.1125,0.04355176608490089,542,"Or, as the King suggested, we could stretch her neck."
4287,0,9,71,80,1.1125,0.0355505968544673,542,Shh...the queen is very sensitive about her teeth.
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,Those are instead of property rights.
4287,3,3,74,80,1.1125,0.04704478744044291,542,She weareth the latest Weight Watcher's device.
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,"It does wonders for a lady's self-esteem - she cannot hear ""locker-room banter"" voiced in public."
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,They call her Silence Partridge.

4287,2,5,73,80,1.1125,0.04355176608490089,542,She's had a ruff life.
4287,3,3,74,80,1.1125,0.04704478744044291,542,I guess the Queen does live in her own little world.
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,"She's getting herself to a nunnery, I wot."
4287,0,9,71,80,1.1125,0.0355505968544673,542,I think it's to cover up her double chin!
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,I moved on her and I failed. I'll admit it.
4287,2,5,73,80,1.1125,0.04355176608490089,542,"I heard that without that collar, she's like a dog with fleas."

4287,0,9,71,80,1.1125,0.0355505968544673,542,Careful with that one--she's ruff trade.
4287,0,9,71,80,1.1125,0.0355505968544673,542,They say she's the final survivor of the great European collar epidemic.
4287,0,9,71,80,1.1125,0.0355505968544673,542,"I'd heard ""she likes it 'ruff'"", but I had no idea!"
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,Nice ruff!
4287,2,5,73,80,1.1125,0.04355176608490089,542,I didn't realize she was so sensitive about the thyroidectomy scar.
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,"That is her take on having a ""stiff upper lip""."
4287,2,5,73,80,1.1125,0.04355176608490089,542,It's something called a tire.

4287,3,3,74,80,1.1125,0.04704478744044291,542,I say jollie old fellow...Trump has placed that thing over her mouth.
4287,2,5,73,80,1.1125,0.04355176608490089,542,I would never have guessed that she likes it ruff.
4287,2,5,73,80,1.1125,0.04355176608490089,542,"For a brief moment, Ilsa's ""dual purpose dog bed"" was all the rage."

4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,I heard that she feels bad about her neck.
4287,2,5,73,80,1.1125,0.04355176608490089,542,And thus begins the Ostrichian Era.
4287,2,5,73,80,1.1125,0.04355176608490089,542,It's called the Royal neck brace.
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,"Her Majesty prefers to be addressed as ""Mum."""
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,Now that's bigly.
4287,2,5,73,80,1.1125,0.04355176608490089,542,Lady Aardvark doth appear headed to the beach this morn.
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,"I know she's a germaphobe, but I preferred it when she just wore that silly surgical mask."
4287,2,5,73,80,1.1125,0.04355176608490089,542,"Alas, she doth sleepwalke anew... methinks this new attire does afforde too much comforte."
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,Guess she had too much to say.
4287,2,5,73,80,1.1125,0.04355176608490089,542,"She's already cuffed, but I'll let you take the collar..."""
4287,0,9,71,80,1.1125,0.0355505968544673,542,"She's been wearing it in response to ""Off with their heads!!!"""
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,"It's the economy, William. The collar has plummeted in value."
4287,2,5,73,80,1.1125,0.04355176608490089,542,I hear she's a wee bit apprehensive about the Pageant Director's affectionate inclinations
4287,2,5,73,80,1.1125,0.04355176608490089,542,"It's a multi-purpose neck brace, mouth warmer, and spare wheel for the wagon and I rather fancy it."
4287,2,5,73,80,1.1125,0.04355176608490089,542,"For a lady, she's a real rough neck."
4287,0,9,71,80,1.1125,0.0355505968544673,542,These new fashions leave a lot to be desired
4287,0,9,71,80,1.1125,0.0355505968544673,542,Collar-a
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,She feels bad about her neck.
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,Nope -- Can't call her a nasty woman.
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,Me thinks she doth protest too much.
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,That's the latest two purpose Ruff everyone is talking about. When you're not wearing it you can use it as a seat cushion.
4287,2,5,73,80,1.1125,0.04355176608490089,542,That looks Ruff.
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,And you thought you had it ruff!!
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,She's not your usual bit of ruff
4287,0,9,71,80,1.1125,0.0355505968544673,542,I thought next week was Jamestown fashion week
4287,3,3,74,80,1.1125,0.04704478744044291,542,She's ahead of her time.
4287,3,3,74,80,1.1125,0.04704478744044291,542,It's from a new fashion designer in olde London towne. Thou shouldest get a load of his codpiece!
4287,0,9,71,80,1.1125,0.0355505968544673,542,She's big on pushing the envelope.
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,It's an engagement gift from the royal court of King Henry VIII.
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,And here I thought last spring's quadroruff was as far as this would go.
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,There goes that nasty woman.
4287,2,5,73,80,1.1125,0.04355176608490089,542,They say she is having a ruff time.
4287,2,5,73,80,1.1125,0.04355176608490089,542,It filters out her filthy rhetoric.
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,"It's great, but is it good?"
4287,0,9,71,80,1.1125,0.0355505968544673,542,She is roughing it today.
4287,2,5,73,80,1.1125,0.04355176608490089,542,What an elegant sleepwalker!
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,Too ruff for me!
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,Nasty woman!
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,"Tis the hay fever, methinks."
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,She walled herself in.
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,"Try to behead me now, Henry VIII!"
4287,1,7,72,80,1.1125,0.03975299526968241,542,She has a ruff life.
4287,3,3,74,80,1.1125,0.04704478744044291,542,Her Highness mustn't know it trendeth downward at the Fifeshire Quarterly.

4422,2,5,74,81,1.1111111111111112,0.04303314829119352,542,Good way to protect herself against unwanted sexual advances
4422,2,5,74,81,1.1111111111111112,0.04303314829119352,542,I think her 'anti-sexual contact device' will need an adjustment before the Trump visit.
4422,1,7,73,81,1.1111111111111112,0.039283710065919304,542,She says it stays on until I let her buy a Burkina!
4422,2,5,74,81,1.1111111111111112,0.04303314829119352,542,"She knows that's not how safe spaces work, right?"
4427,2,4,72,78,1.1025641025641026,0.04314378839150652,542,She won't even talk to me.
4427,2,4,72,78,1.1025641025641026,0.04314378839150652,542,She's teething.
4427,1,6,71,78,1.1025641025641026,0.0390945794678848,542,No teeth
4427,3,2,73,78,1.1025641025641026,0.046844282572918394,542,"She offered a kiss good night, but I searched for an hour and couldn't find the way in."
4427,1,6,71,78,1.1025641025641026,0.0390945794678848,542,She had surgery last week.
4427,2,4,72,78,1.1025641025641026,0.04314378839150652,542,I doth hear she stuffs her ruff.

4427,0,8,70,78,1.1025641025641026,0.03457435192119191,542,She thinks that showing off her starching and ironing skills will get her a good husband.
4427,0,8,70,78,1.1025641025641026,0.03457435192119191,542,"Who ""ruff""led her feathers?"
4427,1,6,71,78,1.1025641025641026,0.0390945794678848,542,I heard she wears that to hide her hickeys.
4427,3,2,73,78,1.1025641025641026,0.046844282572918394,542,She has a well rounded personality.
