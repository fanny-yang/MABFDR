1653,6,13,82,101,1.2475247524752475,0.05523297299398555,541,"'Mr. Healthy' left five minutes ago, headed south"

1653,4,17,80,101,1.2475247524752475,0.05152321517329776,541,You must be the Reaper boy from next door. Beelzebub isn't home right now.
1653,3,19,79,101,1.2475247524752475,0.04956432083478743,541,So you're saying people are taking death more casually these days?
1653,6,13,82,101,1.2475247524752475,0.05523297299398555,541,That's strange! I thought you'd be taller.
1653,3,19,79,101,1.2475247524752475,0.04956432083478743,541,Let me guess: death takes a holiday and hipsters fill in.
1653,6,13,82,101,1.2475247524752475,0.05523297299398555,541,"Well, I'm the Prim Reaper"

1653,4,17,80,101,1.2475247524752475,0.05152321517329776,541,But surely not on your day off.
1653,4,17,80,101,1.2475247524752475,0.05152321517329776,541,"You dressed down, for this?"

1653,5,15,81,101,1.2475247524752475,0.05341031270994525,541,Careful... you'll put your eye out with that thing.
1653,6,13,82,101,1.2475247524752475,0.05523297299398555,541,They let you on the subway with that thing?
1653,6,13,82,101,1.2475247524752475,0.05523297299398555,541,It was a stupid paper cut.
1653,3,19,79,101,1.2475247524752475,0.04956432083478743,541,One more step and I can legally shoot you.
1653,6,13,82,101,1.2475247524752475,0.05523297299398555,541,"Bob, there's a Mr. Reaper here to see you."
1653,4,17,80,101,1.2475247524752475,0.05152321517329776,541,"Well, you certainly ensure that there is no dignity in death, don't you?"
1653,6,13,82,101,1.2475247524752475,0.05523297299398555,541,I think I'll pass.
1653,3,19,79,101,1.2475247524752475,0.04956432083478743,541,"Hey, watch out with that, you'll put your eye out... oh, never mind..."
1653,4,17,80,101,1.2475247524752475,0.05152321517329776,541,"Okay. But first, can you unclog my sink? It's driving me nuts."
1653,4,17,80,101,1.2475247524752475,0.05152321517329776,541,I'll let him know your here

1653,5,15,81,101,1.2475247524752475,0.05341031270994525,541,"This was your fantasy, not mine."
1653,3,19,79,101,1.2475247524752475,0.04956432083478743,541,"It is a grim election, but you're overdoing it."
1653,5,15,81,101,1.2475247524752475,0.05341031270994525,541,"Sorry, we use a mower."

1653,1,23,77,101,1.2475247524752475,0.04539363717365405,541,"Nice try Jim, but I'm still not going jogging with you."
1653,6,13,82,101,1.2475247524752475,0.05523297299398555,541,Not in that outfit
1653,5,15,81,101,1.2475247524752475,0.05341031270994525,541,What a relief. I thought you were going to go as a clown.
1653,5,15,81,101,1.2475247524752475,0.05341031270994525,541,"Sure , my husband can play Hockey with you."
1653,5,15,81,101,1.2475247524752475,0.05341031270994525,541,He's not here right now. Can you come back in an hour?
1754,5,15,82,102,1.2450980392156863,0.05293973839875468,541,Casual Friday? Seriously?
1754,5,15,82,102,1.2450980392156863,0.05293973839875468,541,Charon said he'll meet you at the gym.
1754,7,11,84,102,1.2450980392156863,0.05648796352550144,541,Really? On a Friday?
1754,4,17,81,102,1.2450980392156863,0.051073269338898615,541,"What is this, Casual Death Friday?"
1754,7,11,84,102,1.2450980392156863,0.05648796352550144,541,Your late. He died last week.
1759,2,21,80,103,1.2427184466019416,0.046719978694238794,541,You still need to be back by 10.
1760,5,14,81,100,1.24,0.053409037180286764,541,I'm not going out with you looking like that!
1760,5,14,81,100,1.24,0.053409037180286764,541,I was terrified until I noticed your grim Reebok's.
1760,4,16,80,100,1.24,0.05148305595538256,541,"Since it seems taxes aren't certain, I'm not convinced you are."
1760,4,16,80,100,1.24,0.05148305595538256,541,You're too late. I already voted Libertarian.
1760,7,10,83,100,1.24,0.057066326818585915,541,"""I know that's you, Frank! I wish you would stop going into ""Reaper-mode"" every time my mother coughs!"
1760,4,16,80,100,1.24,0.05148305595538256,541,"You're somewhat scary, but at least you're not a creepy clown."
1760,6,12,82,100,1.24,0.0552679423766206,541,You're Dead to me.
1760,4,16,80,100,1.24,0.05148305595538256,541,"Yes, our relationship is dead, but you don't have to dress the part!"
1760,8,8,84,100,1.24,0.05880974288828221,541,You're too late. The Fitbit already got him.
1760,6,12,82,100,1.24,0.0552679423766206,541,You must be here for America's dignity.
1760,4,16,80,100,1.24,0.05148305595538256,541,"I know it's quiet, but I still prefer my string trimmer."
1760,5,14,81,100,1.24,0.053409037180286764,541,"The grass looks fine, but this month go easier on the hedges."
1760,3,18,79,100,1.24,0.04948216697442473,541,You might be giving people the wrong impression.
1760,5,14,81,100,1.24,0.053409037180286764,541,You're too early. Come back later.
1760,1,22,77,100,1.24,0.04521553322083513,541,Not now. I just cleaned the place.
1760,1,22,77,100,1.24,0.04521553322083513,541,I'm sorry. I'm just the house sitter. The home owner won't be back 'til Thursday.
1760,3,18,79,100,1.24,0.04948216697442473,541,"Well, Junior, I'm glad you found an internship. But don't expect the members of this household to help you reach your monthly quota!"
1760,7,10,83,100,1.24,0.057066326818585915,541,I see it's Casual Friday in the afterlife.
1760,9,6,85,100,1.24,0.060502942578076827,541,"You're going door to door for the GOP, you say?"
1760,3,18,79,100,1.24,0.04948216697442473,541,"Well, I guess I won't be getting that pizza I ordered."
1760,6,12,82,100,1.24,0.0552679423766206,541,Come back when I've finished paying off my student loans.
1760,5,14,81,100,1.24,0.053409037180286764,541,Casual Friday really isn't working for you.
1760,5,14,81,100,1.24,0.053409037180286764,541,"If you're looking for the Trump campaign, it's down the hall."
1760,2,20,78,100,1.24,0.047396884353980984,541,I don't care what Ben Franklin said. I pay enough in taxes to avoid you for now.
1760,5,14,81,100,1.24,0.053409037180286764,541,You got the call saying I'd be here between 48 and 53?
1760,3,18,79,100,1.24,0.04948216697442473,541,That job of yours must be absolute murder.
1760,5,14,81,100,1.24,0.053409037180286764,541,"Reaper...maybe. Grim, not in the least."
1760,6,12,82,100,1.24,0.0552679423766206,541,"No. I ordered a large pizza with pepperoni,"
1760,6,12,82,100,1.24,0.0552679423766206,541,I wouldn't be caught dead on a date with someone dressed like that!
1760,3,18,79,100,1.24,0.04948216697442473,541,Laundry day?
1760,5,14,81,100,1.24,0.053409037180286764,541,Give me a minute to fix my face.
1760,3,18,79,100,1.24,0.04948216697442473,541,"She's in 105 now, down the hall and to the right."
1760,3,18,79,100,1.24,0.04948216697442473,541,The room's already been rented.
1760,3,18,79,100,1.24,0.04948216697442473,541,I really don't see a future for us.
1760,4,16,80,100,1.24,0.05148305595538256,541,You really should update your profile picture.
1760,4,16,80,100,1.24,0.05148305595538256,541,"No, no, I ordered a Weed Whacker!"
1760,5,14,81,100,1.24,0.053409037180286764,541,You can start with my husband in the basement.
1760,6,12,82,100,1.24,0.0552679423766206,541,Ever hear of a lawn mower?
1760,4,16,80,100,1.24,0.05148305595538256,541,What is this -- 'Casual Black Friday'?
1760,6,12,82,100,1.24,0.0552679423766206,541,"How's the cold Agnes, you look like death"""
1760,7,10,83,100,1.24,0.057066326818585915,541,Who buzzed you up?
1760,4,16,80,100,1.24,0.05148305595538256,541,"Frankly, you look more Slacker then Reaper."
1760,5,14,81,100,1.24,0.053409037180286764,541,So casual Friday did die.
1760,3,18,79,100,1.24,0.04948216697442473,541,Happy Halloween to my first trick-or-treater I hope.
1760,4,16,80,100,1.24,0.05148305595538256,541,Can you wait a minute while I finish The New Yorker magazine cartoon caption contest?
1760,3,18,79,100,1.24,0.04948216697442473,541,But I just signed a ten year lease!
1760,4,16,80,100,1.24,0.05148305595538256,541,I guess we could use a little help with the harvest.
1760,2,20,78,100,1.24,0.047396884353980984,541,"Well you're not exactly a snazzy dresser, but you sure do know how to accessorize."
1760,7,10,83,100,1.24,0.057066326818585915,541,Just make it quick.
1760,4,16,80,100,1.24,0.05148305595538256,541,So it's casual Friday is it?
1760,4,16,80,100,1.24,0.05148305595538256,541,"Yeah, well I'll come for YOU if you aren't back by 10!"
1760,4,16,80,100,1.24,0.05148305595538256,541,Finally.... I've been dying to see you!
1760,6,12,82,100,1.24,0.0552679423766206,541,Are you taking me to my eternal lounging place?
1760,4,16,80,100,1.24,0.05148305595538256,541,Take your hand out of your pocket.
1760,6,12,82,100,1.24,0.0552679423766206,541,At least take your shoes off.
1760,5,14,81,100,1.24,0.053409037180286764,541,Why the long scythe?
1760,7,10,83,100,1.24,0.057066326818585915,541,"Sorry, I took a baby aspirin, maybe nextime....."
1760,5,14,81,100,1.24,0.053409037180286764,541,You can wait or come back when his Medicare runs out.
1760,3,18,79,100,1.24,0.04948216697442473,541,Can you wait until the sixth of November?
1760,7,10,83,100,1.24,0.057066326818585915,541,"This casual Friday thing has gotten way, way out of hand."
1760,5,14,81,100,1.24,0.053409037180286764,541,Good Harvest?
1760,4,16,80,100,1.24,0.05148305595538256,541,"Didn't you see the sign!? It says ""No Soliciting""!"
1760,0,24,76,100,1.24,0.042923469599092795,541,You're killing me with those sweats!
1760,4,16,80,100,1.24,0.05148305595538256,541,You were supposed to be home two hours ago and don't tell me you were just killing time!
1760,5,14,81,100,1.24,0.053409037180286764,541,I guess when I asked for a man to come into my life I should've been more specific.
1760,3,18,79,100,1.24,0.04948216697442473,541,Would you like to come in for a cold one?
