813,7,26,103,136,1.2941176470588236,0.04796245701688192,539,Shoulders back! Use your core! You've got this!
813,9,22,105,136,1.2941176470588236,0.05018228977282247,539,"It's OK, he came up this way."
813,10,20,106,136,1.2941176470588236,0.05125616712862132,539,He's coming back up...even more impressive!!
813,10,20,106,136,1.2941176470588236,0.05125616712862132,539,50 dollars says he trips over a loose rock and falls flat on his face.
813,9,22,105,136,1.2941176470588236,0.05018228977282247,539,"So, I'm guessing the blind guide has great hearing."
813,7,26,103,136,1.2941176470588236,0.04796245701688192,539,"As a hiker, Sheldon lacks gravitas."
813,6,28,102,136,1.2941176470588236,0.046813083867895386,539,He chose the path of least resistance.
813,5,30,101,136,1.2941176470588236,0.04563477138486583,539,I heard he's inclined to take risks.
813,5,30,101,136,1.2941176470588236,0.04563477138486583,539,He's always been a path of least resistance kind of guy
813,9,22,105,136,1.2941176470588236,0.05018228977282247,539,I TOLD him to wait a week before installing iOS 10.
813,7,26,103,136,1.2941176470588236,0.04796245701688192,539,If Fred Astaire can do it so can I
813,8,24,104,136,1.2941176470588236,0.04908492380527736,539,There's an app for that.
813,5,30,101,136,1.2941176470588236,0.04563477138486583,539,He did say the hike back down was much easier than the climb up.
813,7,26,103,136,1.2941176470588236,0.04796245701688192,539,I don't think Henderson understands the gravity of the situation
813,10,20,106,136,1.2941176470588236,0.05125616712862132,539,"Don't worry, we'll catch up."
813,8,24,104,136,1.2941176470588236,0.04908492380527736,539,I'm Sorry I told him he's an old goat.
813,5,30,101,136,1.2941176470588236,0.04563477138486583,539,"Well, he always said you and I were vertically challenged."
813,9,22,105,136,1.2941176470588236,0.05018228977282247,539,Joe was raised by geckos.
813,7,26,103,136,1.2941176470588236,0.04796245701688192,539,The ranger said stay on the trail.
883,6,28,103,137,1.2919708029197081,0.04651969017318503,539,He started going downhill fast right after high school.
883,6,28,103,137,1.2919708029197081,0.04651969017318503,539,He's in denial.
885,9,21,104,134,1.291044776119403,0.05061026617466473,539,OK I believe you. Come back up and make us some wine.
885,7,25,102,134,1.291044776119403,0.04834208664303101,539,Because I have cartoon physics on my side - that's why!
885,8,23,103,134,1.291044776119403,0.049489172468696274,539,"As usual, the gravity of our situation is lost on him."
885,7,25,102,134,1.291044776119403,0.04834208664303101,539,"Don't say it's a miracle, we're atheists."
885,4,31,99,134,1.291044776119403,0.04472465527089252,539,He's late for his Cirque du Soleil audition.
885,8,23,103,134,1.291044776119403,0.049489172468696274,539,The old guys don't rely so much on GPS.
885,12,15,107,134,1.291044776119403,0.053833647416579124,539,He bought those shoes from a movie theater employee.
885,10,19,105,134,1.291044776119403,0.05170705844374113,539,He really trusts his GPS.
885,3,33,98,134,1.291044776119403,0.043451972779910995,539,Are you sure there was nothing else in his trail mix?
885,7,25,102,134,1.291044776119403,0.04834208664303101,539,He's taking 'The Road Less Taken' a little too literally.
885,6,27,101,134,1.291044776119403,0.047167112381067695,539,I guess the rules don't apply to this guy
885,12,15,107,134,1.291044776119403,0.053833647416579124,539,"He say's, hold the page sideways."
885,10,19,105,134,1.291044776119403,0.05170705844374113,539,The last time he said 'don't worry just follow me' it didn't end well.
885,6,27,101,134,1.291044776119403,0.047167112381067695,539,I'm not sure you appreciate the gravity of your situation.
885,6,27,101,134,1.291044776119403,0.047167112381067695,539,He finally went over the edge. He's now headed for the deep end.
885,5,29,100,134,1.291044776119403,0.04596211091468952,539,"Don't call his attention to it, let's just see what happens!"
885,8,23,103,134,1.291044776119403,0.049489172468696274,539,He's showboating again. Last week he walked on water.
885,9,21,104,134,1.291044776119403,0.05061026617466473,539,"He's a climate change denyer, too."
903,6,26,101,133,1.2857142857142858,0.047218640111304305,539,"When this Hiking App said proceed South, I was skeptical at first."
903,8,22,103,133,1.2857142857142858,0.049572596331706964,539,You shouldn't have called him vertically challenged.
903,13,12,108,133,1.2857142857142858,0.05501861630239436,539,"When he goes low, we stay high."
903,4,30,99,133,1.2857142857142858,0.04474100625662531,539,They say you are not supposed to wake a sleepwalker.
903,7,24,102,133,1.2857142857142858,0.04840992811927757,539,I've never seen him this on edge before
903,10,18,105,133,1.2857142857142858,0.051819732150715114,539,"He knows there's nothing down there, right?"
903,8,22,103,133,1.2857142857142858,0.049572596331706964,539,There is a down side to everything!
903,7,24,102,133,1.2857142857142858,0.04840992811927757,539,"You can take that 'road less traveled' idea too far, you know!"
903,8,22,103,133,1.2857142857142858,0.049572596331706964,539,I told you we didn't tip him enough.
903,12,14,107,133,1.2857142857142858,0.05397339134497062,539,He'll follow Trump anywhere.
903,7,24,102,133,1.2857142857142858,0.04840992811927757,539,Show off.
903,5,28,100,133,1.2857142857142858,0.04599650864368002,539,Do we tell him?
903,8,22,103,133,1.2857142857142858,0.049572596331706964,539,"Actually, we were supposed to go right."
903,5,28,100,133,1.2857142857142858,0.04599650864368002,539,You guys wait here. I'm going to scout ahead for dangers.
903,9,20,104,133,1.2857142857142858,0.050708613406591115,539,Milo doesn't appreciate the gravity of the situation.
903,6,26,101,133,1.2857142857142858,0.047218640111304305,539,"That's easy, It's getting back up that's hard."
903,10,18,105,133,1.2857142857142858,0.051819732150715114,539,Is it steep?
903,7,24,102,133,1.2857142857142858,0.04840992811927757,539,"Jesus, he's such a show off. First water, now this."
903,7,24,102,133,1.2857142857142858,0.04840992811927757,539,Well! Now you're just showing off...
903,9,20,104,133,1.2857142857142858,0.050708613406591115,539,The really interesting part is he's walking backward.
903,8,22,103,133,1.2857142857142858,0.049572596331706964,539,He lacks Gravitas.
903,5,28,100,133,1.2857142857142858,0.04599650864368002,539,We never should've gone hiking with a zen master.
903,7,24,102,133,1.2857142857142858,0.04840992811927757,539,I see somebody just HAS to show off his new hiking shoes.
903,3,32,98,133,1.2857142857142858,0.0434492402039741,539,Do you think he still needs the walking stick?
903,6,26,101,133,1.2857142857142858,0.047218640111304305,539,He's wearing those stupid virtual reality glasses
903,5,28,100,133,1.2857142857142858,0.04599650864368002,539,You should see what he does on water.
903,6,26,101,133,1.2857142857142858,0.047218640111304305,539,I don't think you realize the gravity of the situation.
903,5,28,100,133,1.2857142857142858,0.04599650864368002,539,He's never known which way is up.
903,7,24,102,133,1.2857142857142858,0.04840992811927757,539,"Believe me when I tell you, it's a shortcut."
903,10,18,105,133,1.2857142857142858,0.051819732150715114,539,"Of course, if he's right and this really is printed sideways, then it's you and me who are in trouble, Dave."
903,8,22,103,133,1.2857142857142858,0.049572596331706964,539,"You know, if the page is rotated to the right, our situation is far less humorous."
903,8,22,103,133,1.2857142857142858,0.049572596331706964,539,Where did he say he bought those boots?
903,7,24,102,133,1.2857142857142858,0.04840992811927757,539,That looks relativity easy.
903,10,18,105,133,1.2857142857142858,0.051819732150715114,539,"Every weekend it's the same - we go out for a hike, and then the survivors are rescued by helicopter."
903,7,24,102,133,1.2857142857142858,0.04840992811927757,539,He never seemed to grasp physics.
903,6,26,101,133,1.2857142857142858,0.047218640111304305,539,Lets find out where he buys his hiking boots.
903,8,22,103,133,1.2857142857142858,0.049572596331706964,539,"Gee, I sure hope he doesn't suddenly wake up now."
903,6,26,101,133,1.2857142857142858,0.047218640111304305,539,"When he goes low, we go high."
903,8,22,103,133,1.2857142857142858,0.049572596331706964,539,Morris never understood the gravity of the situation.
903,9,20,104,133,1.2857142857142858,0.050708613406591115,539,I take the road less travelled.
903,6,26,101,133,1.2857142857142858,0.047218640111304305,539,He's always taking the road not taken.
903,7,24,102,133,1.2857142857142858,0.04840992811927757,539,The gravity of this situation doesn't seem to affect him.
903,6,26,101,133,1.2857142857142858,0.047218640111304305,539,They say it's harder going down.
903,8,22,103,133,1.2857142857142858,0.049572596331706964,539,"He was right. It is, in fact, all downhill from here."
903,11,16,106,133,1.2857142857142858,0.05290752126800691,539,I don't think Jeffrey realizes the gravity of the situation.
903,4,30,99,133,1.2857142857142858,0.04474100625662531,539,Do you think he understands the gravity of his actions?
903,7,24,102,133,1.2857142857142858,0.04840992811927757,539,I'd wait until he's at least halfway down.
903,10,18,105,133,1.2857142857142858,0.051819732150715114,539,Just because he's our guide doesn't mean we have to follow him... right?
903,7,24,102,133,1.2857142857142858,0.04840992811927757,539,"Like I said, Frank, it's all downhill from here."
903,7,24,102,133,1.2857142857142858,0.04840992811927757,539,"Call me chicken, but I'm going back the way we came!"
903,7,24,102,133,1.2857142857142858,0.04840992811927757,539,"The Swiss...great mountaineers, poor team players."
903,6,26,101,133,1.2857142857142858,0.047218640111304305,539,Talk about the power of positive thinking!
903,8,22,103,133,1.2857142857142858,0.049572596331706964,539,Is there a downside?
903,8,22,103,133,1.2857142857142858,0.049572596331706964,539,We're both sorry if we upset you.
903,7,24,102,133,1.2857142857142858,0.04840992811927757,539,I guess he doesn't get the gravity of the situation.
903,5,28,100,133,1.2857142857142858,0.04599650864368002,539,"This feels like one of those, 'if all your friends jumped off a cliff' moments."
903,11,16,106,133,1.2857142857142858,0.05290752126800691,539,"Sorry for the confusion, Cliff, but I wasn't just saying your name."
903,6,26,101,133,1.2857142857142858,0.047218640111304305,539,He's gotten good at scaling back.
903,8,22,103,133,1.2857142857142858,0.049572596331706964,539,Always with that unbeaten path thing.
903,8,22,103,133,1.2857142857142858,0.049572596331706964,539,And you thought hiking up was difficult.
903,6,26,101,133,1.2857142857142858,0.047218640111304305,539,Where did he say he got those new hiking shoes?
903,12,14,107,133,1.2857142857142858,0.05397339134497062,539,I told him to go straight to hell
903,12,14,107,133,1.2857142857142858,0.05397339134497062,539,He's voting for Trump
903,6,26,101,133,1.2857142857142858,0.047218640111304305,539,I always knew he would go off the deep end .
967,6,26,102,134,1.2835820895522387,0.046913416235472225,539,You're next...No you're next...No go ahead...No you go ahead...
967,10,18,106,134,1.2835820895522387,0.0514757421065385,539,"Aye, he’ll be in Scotland afore us."

970,6,25,100,131,1.282442748091603,0.04757762043207198,539,"Well, he's clever enough, but he lacks _gravitas_."
970,6,25,100,131,1.282442748091603,0.04757762043207198,539,"We get it already, you're the more experienced hiker."
970,6,25,100,131,1.282442748091603,0.04757762043207198,539,Technically it is a short-cut!
970,8,21,102,131,1.282442748091603,0.049985093679725305,539,He's also the libertarian candidate for President.
970,8,21,102,131,1.282442748091603,0.049985093679725305,539,I could never walk in his footsteps.
970,9,19,103,131,1.282442748091603,0.05114635277580617,539,I'm pretty sure they wouldn't put a Pokemon three quarters of the way down the cliff.
970,7,23,101,131,1.282442748091603,0.04879620659513006,539,"I bet you feel really stupid for yelling, 'Don't do it!'"
970,6,25,100,131,1.282442748091603,0.04757762043207198,539,I think we should take the long way down.
970,6,25,100,131,1.282442748091603,0.04757762043207198,539,...because he can.
970,7,23,101,131,1.282442748091603,0.04879620659513006,539,I hope he appreciates the gravity of his achievement.
970,5,27,99,131,1.282442748091603,0.04632699163427313,539,"He's in the zone. Just watch, he'll get halfway down and go oops."
970,8,21,102,131,1.282442748091603,0.049985093679725305,539,Um...you second!

970,7,23,101,131,1.282442748091603,0.04879620659513006,539,I think I'll go around.
970,8,21,102,131,1.282442748091603,0.049985093679725305,539,He doesn't appreciate the gravity of his predicament.
985,8,20,102,130,1.2769230769230768,0.050063030772570245,539,What's impressive is he is walking backwards too...
985,6,24,100,130,1.2769230769230768,0.04762127551191367,539,"When we are lost, he never admits it."
985,5,26,99,130,1.2769230769230768,0.04635218761832849,539,"Who's the lemming now, Eugene?"

985,8,20,102,130,1.2769230769230768,0.050063030772570245,539,"OK, you've got the shoe endorsement. Now get back up here."
985,7,22,101,130,1.2769230769230768,0.04885740952771086,539,Well of course 'downhill' is always easier.
985,8,20,102,130,1.2769230769230768,0.050063030772570245,539,"Well, I did tell him a ninety-degree turn."
985,7,22,101,130,1.2769230769230768,0.04885740952771086,539,"Give him a sec, it always takes a bit for gravity to catch up to cartoons."
985,5,26,99,130,1.2769230769230768,0.04635218761832849,539,Your knees! Bend your knees!
985,6,24,100,130,1.2769230769230768,0.04762127551191367,539,That is a serious updraft...
985,10,16,104,130,1.2769230769230768,0.05239110820443715,539,We all laughed at him for majoring in Cartoon Physics.
985,9,18,103,130,1.2769230769230768,0.051240293075978584,539,Believe me- this is the best trail. Nobody builds a trail better than me. I guarantee it.
985,6,24,100,130,1.2769230769230768,0.04762127551191367,539,He has great faith in Google Maps.
985,8,20,102,130,1.2769230769230768,0.050063030772570245,539,It's not his sure-footedness I'm questioning.
985,6,24,100,130,1.2769230769230768,0.04762127551191367,539,Right behind you.
985,8,20,102,130,1.2769230769230768,0.050063030772570245,539,A journey of a thousand feet begins with a single step.
985,8,20,102,130,1.2769230769230768,0.050063030772570245,539,He has never been able to confront reality.

985,9,18,103,130,1.2769230769230768,0.051240293075978584,539,I think you should go first.
985,8,20,102,130,1.2769230769230768,0.050063030772570245,539,His new smart phone comes with that app.
985,5,26,99,130,1.2769230769230768,0.04635218761832849,539,"If someone turns the magazine 90 degrees to the right, that guy is fine, but we are in a heap of trouble."
985,6,24,100,130,1.2769230769230768,0.04762127551191367,539,"Gravity's a state of mind, boys."
985,9,18,103,130,1.2769230769230768,0.051240293075978584,539,"Oh, just let him go---I'm sick of his bragging about his homemade nutrition bars."
985,6,24,100,130,1.2769230769230768,0.04762127551191367,539,Or we could just make camp?
985,6,24,100,130,1.2769230769230768,0.04762127551191367,539,I'll let you tell him he's going the wrong way.
985,7,22,101,130,1.2769230769230768,0.04885740952771086,539,He's the Fred Astaire of hiking.
985,8,20,102,130,1.2769230769230768,0.050063030772570245,539,Did he mention where he bought his hiking boots?
985,7,22,101,130,1.2769230769230768,0.04885740952771086,539,Do you ever get the feeling we're in an Escher painting?
985,8,20,102,130,1.2769230769230768,0.050063030772570245,539,"I thought ""race to the bottom"" only has to do with economics and trade."

985,7,22,101,130,1.2769230769230768,0.04885740952771086,539,"I never said it was a good idea, I just said lemmings do it all the time."
985,5,26,99,130,1.2769230769230768,0.04635218761832849,539,It's all about core strength.

1026,6,23,100,129,1.2713178294573644,0.047658265997511384,539,He'd never let a little thing like gravity stand in his way.
1026,10,15,104,129,1.2713178294573644,0.0524957754673703,539,This is the last time I'm going hiking with M.C. Escher!
1026,9,17,103,129,1.2713178294573644,0.051329157512205535,539,"Okay, this game of 'Follow the Leader' has definitely taken a down turn."
1026,5,25,99,129,1.2713178294573644,0.04637010121707519,539,He must have set his phone to landscape
1026,5,25,99,129,1.2713178294573644,0.04637010121707519,539,"Well, he's not coming back"
1026,8,19,102,129,1.2713178294573644,0.0501354004661881,539,That's not south!
1026,7,21,101,129,1.2713178294573644,0.048912517302806054,539,"First he denied climate change, but gravity?"

1026,7,21,101,129,1.2713178294573644,0.048912517302806054,539,The gravity of the situation doesn't appear to phase him at all.
1026,9,17,103,129,1.2713178294573644,0.051329157512205535,539,Just like him to show off by climbing up backwards!

1026,8,19,102,129,1.2713178294573644,0.0501354004661881,539,He claims it's just a matter of perspective.
1026,4,27,98,129,1.2713178294573644,0.04504511356267232,539,Looks like we'll be back at camp sooner than I thought.
1026,9,17,103,129,1.2713178294573644,0.051329157512205535,539,Try not to look down...
1026,6,23,100,129,1.2713178294573644,0.047658265997511384,539,... and grab me a cup of coffee when you come back up.
1026,7,21,101,129,1.2713178294573644,0.048912517302806054,539,Hiking really changed his perspective.
1026,9,17,103,129,1.2713178294573644,0.051329157512205535,539,We know you have a way.But do you also have a will?
1026,8,19,102,129,1.2713178294573644,0.0501354004661881,539,Wow...Glen really went downhill.
1026,7,21,101,129,1.2713178294573644,0.048912517302806054,539,I'll take that bet.
1026,7,21,101,129,1.2713178294573644,0.048912517302806054,539,He's right - this cartoon IS sideways.
1026,5,25,99,129,1.2713178294573644,0.04637010121707519,539,I've always admired Fred's sticktuitiveness.
1026,3,29,97,129,1.2713178294573644,0.04367995220769242,539,The brochure did guarantee the most direct route
1026,8,19,102,129,1.2713178294573644,0.0501354004661881,539,We better hope no one rotates this cartoon.
1062,9,17,104,130,1.2692307692307692,0.050975529970268434,539,"Okay, you go next!"
1062,4,27,99,130,1.2692307692307692,0.04474596891190779,539,Well now I don't feel so bad about not warning him.
1062,8,19,103,130,1.2692307692307692,0.04979200810745508,539,What are the odds he'd find a velcro cliff for his velcro shoes?
1062,5,25,100,130,1.2692307692307692,0.04605933475683601,539,He said getting back would be harder.
1062,8,19,103,130,1.2692307692307692,0.04979200810745508,539,"WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T LOOK DOWN!"
1062,8,19,103,130,1.2692307692307692,0.04979200810745508,539,He has a Pre-Newtonian concept of gravity
1062,7,21,102,130,1.2692307692307692,0.04857966124826323,539,"Damn it, Escher, cut it out!"
1062,8,19,103,130,1.2692307692307692,0.04979200810745508,539,The joke's on him...he's wearing MY Fitbit.
1062,4,27,99,130,1.2692307692307692,0.04474596891190779,539,It's OK. He was raised by goats.
1062,9,17,104,130,1.2692307692307692,0.050975529970268434,539,It's not as easy as it looks.
1062,5,25,100,130,1.2692307692307692,0.04605933475683601,539,Never wake up a sleep walker.

1074,5,24,98,127,1.2677165354330708,0.04669935501144436,539,Now that's a real cliffhanger.

1218,9,14,101,124,1.2580645161290323,0.05231459806269171,539,"Very convincing, Jesus. But can you do it on water?"
1218,7,18,99,124,1.2580645161290323,0.04974491414544795,539,"Yeah, but the hike back up is a killer."
1218,5,22,97,124,1.2580645161290323,0.047035048593734724,539,He's always marched to a different drummer.
1218,10,12,102,124,1.2580645161290323,0.05355322132255433,539,Kind of a comedown. A little while ago he was walking on air.
1218,7,18,99,124,1.2580645161290323,0.04974491414544795,539,You hear that. He knows the words to Edelweiss.
1218,6,20,98,124,1.2580645161290323,0.04840894689803205,539,"Okay, the Sermon on the Mount was amazing, but now He is just showing off!"
1218,7,18,99,124,1.2580645161290323,0.04974491414544795,539,Smart boots.
1218,7,18,99,124,1.2580645161290323,0.04974491414544795,539,"Okay, that is pretty cool....but the boots are still ugly."
1218,6,20,98,124,1.2580645161290323,0.04840894689803205,539,C'mon Larry! Can't you take a joke?
1218,4,24,96,124,1.2580645161290323,0.04561979233461597,539,"Sherpa, my butt. He's just got better shoes."
1218,7,18,99,124,1.2580645161290323,0.04974491414544795,539,He was more impressive when he walked on water.
1218,7,18,99,124,1.2580645161290323,0.04974491414544795,539,". . . and yet again proving the fallacy of the ""slippery slope"" argument"
1218,7,18,99,124,1.2580645161290323,0.04974491414544795,539,The going down part is easy - coming back up really tests you
1218,4,24,96,124,1.2580645161290323,0.04561979233461597,539,I told you we should have bought the more expensive hiking boots
1218,6,20,98,124,1.2580645161290323,0.04840894689803205,539,"Don't worry, it's only a fiscal cliff..."
1218,6,20,98,124,1.2580645161290323,0.04840894689803205,539,You're over thinking it.
1218,8,16,100,124,1.2580645161290323,0.051045928602577964,539,Bring us back some sandwiches!
1218,6,20,98,124,1.2580645161290323,0.04840894689803205,539,"Well, always trust the G.P.S."
1218,5,22,97,124,1.2580645161290323,0.047035048593734724,539,He's been going down hill for some time now.
1218,3,26,95,124,1.2580645161290323,0.04415920186203535,539,"Come on , try the road less traveled"
1218,3,26,95,124,1.2580645161290323,0.04415920186203535,539,I guess that explains why he didn't feel he had to be nice to us on the way up.
1218,9,14,101,124,1.2580645161290323,0.05231459806269171,539,Fred!?! Do you understand the gravity of this situation??
1218,6,20,98,124,1.2580645161290323,0.04840894689803205,539,You've really got to hand it to those REI people.
1218,7,18,99,124,1.2580645161290323,0.04974491414544795,539,And the signs of dehydration are what again?
1218,6,20,98,124,1.2580645161290323,0.04840894689803205,539,And you told me he was on the level.
1318,3,27,98,128,1.2578125,0.043309926381594484,539,Physics was never his strong suit.
1318,8,17,103,128,1.2578125,0.049908989205293415,539,"You're not fooling anyone, Superman."
1320,6,20,99,125,1.256,0.04806447282959729,539,"After you, Ted."
1320,6,20,99,125,1.256,0.04806447282959729,539,Tell me again what he's been putting into his trail mix?
1320,6,20,99,125,1.256,0.04806447282959729,539,I told you we are on Mt. Velcro.
1320,8,16,101,125,1.256,0.05067798402182282,539,I bet he thinks he can walk on water too!
1324,6,19,98,123,1.2520325203252032,0.048423770127791824,539,I guess the rules don't apply to him.
1324,3,25,95,123,1.2520325203252032,0.04410239732049511,539,Every man walks his own reality.
1324,8,15,100,123,1.2520325203252032,0.0511020699780237,539,"According to cartoons, this only lasts until he realizes where he is."
1324,6,19,98,123,1.2520325203252032,0.048423770127791824,539,He never did know up from down...
1324,4,23,96,123,1.2520325203252032,0.04558839184199874,539,He told me he's all in for being downwardly mobile!
1324,7,17,99,123,1.2520325203252032,0.04978093545438884,539,He does have a certain stick-to-it-iveness...
1324,3,25,95,123,1.2520325203252032,0.04410239732049511,539,Think he knows what's up?
1324,7,17,99,123,1.2520325203252032,0.04978093545438884,539,Only Bob would think to Velcro the entire cliffside.
1324,5,21,97,123,1.2520325203252032,0.04702745466282882,539,He just does what his GPS tells him to do.
1324,3,25,95,123,1.2520325203252032,0.04410239732049511,539,He's always had a hard time asking for directions.
1324,4,23,96,123,1.2520325203252032,0.04558839184199874,539,It's all downhill from here.
1324,5,21,97,123,1.2520325203252032,0.04702745466282882,539,Well he certainly makes that look easy.
1324,7,17,99,123,1.2520325203252032,0.04978093545438884,539,I'm starting to rethink this whole agnostic thing.
1324,6,19,98,123,1.2520325203252032,0.048423770127791824,539,Everyone knows that going down is easier!
1324,5,21,97,123,1.2520325203252032,0.04702745466282882,539,He's always had a lousy sense of direction.
1324,5,21,97,123,1.2520325203252032,0.04702745466282882,539,"See, gravity is just a theory."
1324,4,23,96,123,1.2520325203252032,0.04558839184199874,539,"According to ancestry.com, he's part goat."
1324,5,21,97,123,1.2520325203252032,0.04702745466282882,539,I can hear my mom's voice asking me if I'd go after him.
1324,6,19,98,123,1.2520325203252032,0.048423770127791824,539,There's nothing down there anyway.
1324,8,15,100,123,1.2520325203252032,0.0511020699780237,539,"I'm not stopping until I hit my 10,000 steps."
1324,6,19,98,123,1.2520325203252032,0.048423770127791824,539,"Allen is amazing, he'll walk until he drops."
1324,10,11,102,123,1.2520325203252032,0.053646822820074234,539,Hey! Fred? You gotta hole in your pants.
1324,7,17,99,123,1.2520325203252032,0.04978093545438884,539,His GPS was hacked by Russian squirrels.
1324,3,25,95,123,1.2520325203252032,0.04410239732049511,539,Do you think we should tell him?
1324,7,17,99,123,1.2520325203252032,0.04978093545438884,539,Fred will go anywhere to catch a new Pokémon
1324,7,17,99,123,1.2520325203252032,0.04978093545438884,539,"My mom asked me once what I would do in this very scenario, but I assumed it was rhetorical."
1350,7,17,100,124,1.25,0.04941965852606572,539,See? You just gotta find the right angle.
1350,4,23,97,124,1.25,0.04526490492808352,539,This is a real cliff hanger.
1350,5,21,98,124,1.25,0.04669091947809488,539,He teaches Relativity at Princeton.
1350,9,13,102,124,1.25,0.05200541640979274,539,Yeah! Well Yodel-Ay-Dee-Effin-O to you too!
1350,7,17,100,124,1.25,0.04941965852606572,539,"A bit overboard even for Pokemon, I'd say."
1350,5,21,98,124,1.25,0.04669091947809488,539,I guess the more expensive shoes are worth it.
1350,3,25,96,124,1.25,0.043792479657892625,539,"He's one of those ""the world is flat"" believers."
1350,6,19,99,124,1.25,0.04807465345971242,539,"He's one of those ""gravity is a theory"" types....."
1350,6,19,99,124,1.25,0.04807465345971242,539,"I suppose he walks on water, too"
1350,4,23,97,124,1.25,0.04526490492808352,539,I'd rather take the stairs.
1350,6,19,99,124,1.25,0.04807465345971242,539,watch him pick up speed!
1350,7,17,100,124,1.25,0.04941965852606572,539,If you turn this picture sideways we're the ones defying gravity.
1350,3,25,96,124,1.25,0.043792479657892625,539,What he doesn't realize is that going down is hell on the knees.
1350,8,15,101,124,1.25,0.050729015290999296,539,He doesn't believe in global warming OR gravity.
1364,4,23,98,125,1.248,0.04494584555059639,539,This is the third game in a row of Follow the Leader that he has won.
1364,8,15,102,125,1.248,0.05036127544568475,539,I guess those boots were worth the extra ten dollars.
1366,6,18,97,121,1.2479338842975207,0.04878833766329071,539,"Whatever you do, don't look straight!"
1366,6,18,97,121,1.2479338842975207,0.04878833766329071,539,CHECK YOUR GPS!
1366,3,24,94,121,1.2479338842975207,0.0443517615371859,539,"What did he just say? He said so far, so good."
1366,6,18,97,121,1.2479338842975207,0.04878833766329071,539,I told you we needed to work on our core.
1366,5,20,96,121,1.2479338842975207,0.04735568440129775,539,He wrote the book on vertical descents.
1366,6,18,97,121,1.2479338842975207,0.04878833766329071,539,He's underleveredged.
1366,6,18,97,121,1.2479338842975207,0.04878833766329071,539,He always sticks to the trail.
1366,5,20,96,121,1.2479338842975207,0.04735568440129775,539,It's steeper than it looks.
1366,4,22,95,121,1.2479338842975207,0.04587831512036333,539,Well this is a cliffhanger.
1366,4,22,95,121,1.2479338842975207,0.04587831512036333,539,"Isaac, come back, you've made your point."
1366,3,24,94,121,1.2479338842975207,0.0443517615371859,539,Just don't look down.
1366,4,22,95,121,1.2479338842975207,0.04587831512036333,539,Do you think he's coming back up?
1366,6,18,97,121,1.2479338842975207,0.04878833766329071,539,Now do you believe me that he's the guy who invented Velcro.
1366,6,18,97,121,1.2479338842975207,0.04878833766329071,539,"I don't care what he said, I'm calling an Uber."
1366,5,20,96,121,1.2479338842975207,0.04735568440129775,539,"OK, so alternative universes may exist. But they definitely aren't parallel!"
1366,6,18,97,121,1.2479338842975207,0.04878833766329071,539,"And to think, when he said gravity was a hoax perpetrated by China, I just laughed."
1366,6,18,97,121,1.2479338842975207,0.04878833766329071,539,It was a matter of time before he went off the cliff.
1366,6,18,97,121,1.2479338842975207,0.04878833766329071,539,Good thing his parents never let him watch cartoons as a kid.
1366,4,22,95,121,1.2479338842975207,0.04587831512036333,539,Relativity is a theory. Gravity is a law!
1366,7,16,98,121,1.2479338842975207,0.050180105009647265,539,The GPS is acting up again!
1366,5,20,96,121,1.2479338842975207,0.04735568440129775,539,What was it you said he invented? Velcro?
1366,6,18,97,121,1.2479338842975207,0.04878833766329071,539,They say going down can be as dangerous as climbing up.
1366,7,16,98,121,1.2479338842975207,0.050180105009647265,539,Walking on water's already been done.
1366,7,16,98,121,1.2479338842975207,0.050180105009647265,539,The audacity of Velcro continues to astonish me.
1366,6,18,97,121,1.2479338842975207,0.04878833766329071,539,"Nah, downhill's too hard on the knees."
1366,5,20,96,121,1.2479338842975207,0.04735568440129775,539,Let's just take a cab.
1366,8,14,99,121,1.2479338842975207,0.05153429911826863,539,That's not the way we came!
1366,3,24,94,121,1.2479338842975207,0.0443517615371859,539,His faith in GPS is truly powerful.
1366,7,16,98,121,1.2479338842975207,0.050180105009647265,539,"It helps to have a good attitude, eat a healthy diet and have special boots."
1366,4,22,95,121,1.2479338842975207,0.04587831512036333,539,He used to work for Lehman Brothers.
1366,4,22,95,121,1.2479338842975207,0.04587831512036333,539,Is he trying out the Velcro Trail?
1366,3,24,94,121,1.2479338842975207,0.0443517615371859,539,"Sure it looks impressive. But when you turn your head sideways, WE'RE the ones defying gravity."
1366,7,16,98,121,1.2479338842975207,0.050180105009647265,539,He's in total denial.
1366,3,24,94,121,1.2479338842975207,0.0443517615371859,539,That's nothing; you should hear him yodel.
1366,6,18,97,121,1.2479338842975207,0.04878833766329071,539,"And, I thought the ad for those shoes was a lot of bunk."
1366,7,16,98,121,1.2479338842975207,0.050180105009647265,539,I love convincing Libertarians that the government invented gravity.

2074,3,16,90,109,1.201834862385321,0.044736204398555954,539,"I feel like our expedition is going downhill, Bob"
2074,3,16,90,109,1.201834862385321,0.044736204398555954,539,He's an executive at Wells Fargo...not sure it can last
2074,3,16,90,109,1.201834862385321,0.044736204398555954,539,Billy!
2074,4,14,91,109,1.201834862385321,0.046596380216674414,539,"Harry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it literally!"
2074,4,14,91,109,1.201834862385321,0.046596380216674414,539,I told you this would happen. He's a millennial and you have to tell him why he can't.
2074,6,10,93,109,1.201834862385321,0.05010999880175518,539,Henry never did have that much respect for politics or gravity.
2074,4,14,91,109,1.201834862385321,0.046596380216674414,539,He's like Donald Trump's hair.
2074,5,12,92,109,1.201834862385321,0.04838509392989122,539,He says it's a matter of confidence.
2074,3,16,90,109,1.201834862385321,0.044736204398555954,539,"Yeah, but I bet you can't walk on water!"
2074,5,12,92,109,1.201834862385321,0.04838509392989122,539,And you laughed when I suggested the Elon Musk shoes.
2074,4,14,91,109,1.201834862385321,0.046596380216674414,539,"At least, he's no longer trying to walk on water!"
2074,6,10,93,109,1.201834862385321,0.05010999880175518,539,"Cliff, certainly enjoys living life on the edge."

2074,5,12,92,109,1.201834862385321,0.04838509392989122,539,"You don't need to understand it, just have faith."
2074,4,14,91,109,1.201834862385321,0.046596380216674414,539,Hmm... I don't know. My GPS says go North.
2074,5,12,92,109,1.201834862385321,0.04838509392989122,539,He said it's a shortcut.
2074,1,20,88,109,1.201834862385321,0.04076197558232867,539,I told you he follows his own path.
2074,2,18,89,109,1.201834862385321,0.0427952487863065,539,He says his GPS has never failed him.
2175,5,12,93,110,1.2,0.047978310362298264,539,Why didn't we think of that before?
2175,2,18,90,110,1.2,0.04244409559694416,539,Either he's walking sideways or we shouldn't have eaten those strange mushrooms.
2175,4,14,92,110,1.2,0.046207278580632616,539,He never could understand topographical maps.
2175,2,18,90,110,1.2,0.04244409559694416,539,"On the other hand, I once followed him off a pier and it was all right"
2175,2,18,90,110,1.2,0.04244409559694416,539,He's an economist and just assumed he could walk this way.
2175,2,18,90,110,1.2,0.04244409559694416,539,"Change the orientation to landscape? He'd be ok, but we're doomed!"
2175,2,18,90,110,1.2,0.04244409559694416,539,"I told you, going down hill is always easier."
2175,3,16,91,110,1.2,0.0443656051737758,539,What do you expect? He totally bombed Physics.
2175,8,6,96,110,1.2,0.05293708793841515,539,Is that a Trump bumper sticker on his backpack?
2175,3,16,91,110,1.2,0.0443656051737758,539,Backwards! It's a new record.
2175,3,16,91,110,1.2,0.0443656051737758,539,Did he mention where he bought his walking stick?
2175,3,16,91,110,1.2,0.0443656051737758,539,"After they came out with Velcro laces, it was just a matter of time."
2175,4,14,92,110,1.2,0.046207278580632616,539,His extreme mindfulness creates its own gravity.
2175,4,14,92,110,1.2,0.046207278580632616,539,Should we be concerned?
2175,3,16,91,110,1.2,0.0443656051737758,539,Don't expect a big celebration when you reach the bottom!
2175,2,18,90,110,1.2,0.04244409559694416,539,"Well, let's do it -- but the ascent is going to be murder."
2175,3,16,91,110,1.2,0.0443656051737758,539,"Wait, is he facing straight down or are we facing straight up?"
2175,1,20,89,110,1.2,0.04043136875805354,539,It's faster going down
2175,3,16,91,110,1.2,0.0443656051737758,539,What he lacks in youth he makes up for in technique.
2175,5,12,93,110,1.2,0.047978310362298264,539,So Reinhold is at last over the hill.
2175,4,14,92,110,1.2,0.046207278580632616,539,Did you leave the chocolate in his backpack?
2175,3,16,91,110,1.2,0.0443656051737758,539,He practices mindfulness.
2175,4,14,92,110,1.2,0.046207278580632616,539,Those boots are gonna cost him an arm and a leg.
2175,2,18,90,110,1.2,0.04244409559694416,539,That's impressive but can he walk on water?
2175,3,16,91,110,1.2,0.0443656051737758,539,I think the goatee is for real.
2175,1,20,89,110,1.2,0.04043136875805354,539,I’ve always admired Elmer’s sticktuitiveness.
2175,3,16,91,110,1.2,0.0443656051737758,539,There goes Cliff.
2175,3,16,91,110,1.2,0.0443656051737758,539,But...Mr. Escher...
2175,4,14,92,110,1.2,0.046207278580632616,539,I still can't believe Trump's the nominee.
2175,4,14,92,110,1.2,0.046207278580632616,539,"He said, ""Because it wasn't there."""
2175,2,18,90,110,1.2,0.04244409559694416,539,"Two days ago, it was turning water into wine. Yesterday, it was walking on water. This guy is starting to irritate me!"
2175,4,14,92,110,1.2,0.046207278580632616,539,"Of course, his hiking boots are the best, too."
2207,2,18,91,111,1.1981981981981982,0.042098554117389164,539,"I sure get sick of his ""It's all downhill from here"" attitude."

2207,4,14,93,111,1.1981981981981982,0.04582454131112576,539,Remember his ideas on maintaining a positive attitude that we all found so annoying?
2207,6,10,95,111,1.1981981981981982,0.04926955362062254,539,Just wait until he sees a spider.

2697,2,14,86,102,1.1764705882352942,0.04274543644192702,539,I guess he'll start crawling again when he reaches the bottom.
2697,1,16,85,102,1.1764705882352942,0.04041083116994654,539,That GoPro makes him reckless.

3352,1,11,82,94,1.1382978723404256,0.03886123183444542,539,Go ahead and follow. Remember he told us downhill would be the easy part.
3352,2,9,83,94,1.1382978723404256,0.04170103043206108,539,I told him to turn South.

3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,It all started last month after he was bitten by a radioactive Ibex.
3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,"Seriously, Bob? Mucilage?"
3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,Dang ... you shouldn't have made that $100 bet
3542,0,12,80,92,1.1304347826086956,0.035304258388745666,539,"Whell, he did tell me his career was going downhill..."
3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,"Oh, Myron! I told him to wash that sticky stuff off the bottom of his shoes and clean his glasses..."
3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,He says hiking backwards gives him a better grip on life.
3542,0,12,80,92,1.1304347826086956,0.035304258388745666,539,Dave always has looked at things from a different perspective.
3542,3,6,83,92,1.1304347826086956,0.0443064926404407,539,The average of maps predicted he should go that way.
3542,0,12,80,92,1.1304347826086956,0.035304258388745666,539,He should have gone potty before we left.
3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,"When he said his name was Peter Parker, I didn't think he meant that Peter Parker."
3542,2,8,82,92,1.1304347826086956,0.041523171204257234,539,Hey! Where'd you get those boots?
3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,"Maybe we shouldn't have taken him to ""Wicked."""
3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,"If you ever reach Nietzsche, don't forget where you come from!"
3542,4,4,84,92,1.1304347826086956,0.04692501287519052,539,"He's wearing the new Nike Air Sir Edmund Hillary's, looks like we should get a pair..."
3542,2,8,82,92,1.1304347826086956,0.041523171204257234,539,"Ever since he saw 'Wicked,' he's been obsessed with defying gravity."
3542,2,8,82,92,1.1304347826086956,0.041523171204257234,539,Hey Waldo! Turn around. You are going the wrong way.
3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,He's right . . . gravity is different Down Under.
3542,3,6,83,92,1.1304347826086956,0.0443064926404407,539,Hold on. I'll get a better look.
3542,3,6,83,92,1.1304347826086956,0.0443064926404407,539,It must be those new Teva's.
3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,"It's less of a ""leap"" of faith, really."
3542,0,12,80,92,1.1304347826086956,0.035304258388745666,539,You're always in such a hurry.
3542,2,8,82,92,1.1304347826086956,0.041523171204257234,539,They don't call him the Human Fly for nothing!
3542,2,8,82,92,1.1304347826086956,0.041523171204257234,539,"He told me to get a ""Grip"" on Life !"
3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,He just took off without so much as a sideways glance.
3542,3,6,83,92,1.1304347826086956,0.0443064926404407,539,I think you parked your car the other way.
3542,0,12,80,92,1.1304347826086956,0.035304258388745666,539,This trip has given me a whole new perspective.
3542,2,8,82,92,1.1304347826086956,0.041523171204257234,539,"'Egad! He was right after all about magnetizing his spiked soles when climbing iron mountains!"""
3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,Is he yodeling?
3542,2,8,82,92,1.1304347826086956,0.041523171204257234,539,"Forgot to say ""belay off""."
3542,0,12,80,92,1.1304347826086956,0.035304258388745666,539,Abe just went AWALL...
3542,3,6,83,92,1.1304347826086956,0.0443064926404407,539,And we thought gravity defying hiking boots were just a gimmick.
3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,Going back for my phone so I can take a selfie.
3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,He's the rebellious son of Fred Astaire.
3542,0,12,80,92,1.1304347826086956,0.035304258388745666,539,He wasn't kidding about going in search of the lowest common denominator.
3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,He really needs to turn the page
3542,3,6,83,92,1.1304347826086956,0.0443064926404407,539,"Hold tight, I'm not sure the cartoon was printed in the right orientation?"
3542,2,8,82,92,1.1304347826086956,0.041523171204257234,539,He decided to take the Longitudinal Path...
3542,3,6,83,92,1.1304347826086956,0.0443064926404407,539,Wow! Those inversion boots are really versatile!
3542,5,2,85,92,1.1304347826086956,0.04940494283547108,539,I'll give you a Cliff Bar if you go next.
3542,2,8,82,92,1.1304347826086956,0.041523171204257234,539,He's got new L.L. Bean boots.
3542,2,8,82,92,1.1304347826086956,0.041523171204257234,539,That lucky dog inherited Arnold Palmer's golf shoes.
3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,Come back Harry. You did NOT leave the garage door open!
3542,2,8,82,92,1.1304347826086956,0.041523171204257234,539,He told me he's going sideways because upside down would be too hard
3542,0,12,80,92,1.1304347826086956,0.035304258388745666,539,He now lives life over the edge.
3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,"Oh, his name is Peter Parker."
3542,2,8,82,92,1.1304347826086956,0.041523171204257234,539,"Harry has such willpower, but not a lot of smarts."
3542,3,6,83,92,1.1304347826086956,0.0443064926404407,539,Let us know when you discover gravity.
3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,I hope he's thought about the fact that he has to climb back up.
3542,3,6,83,92,1.1304347826086956,0.0443064926404407,539,His beard resists gravity.
3542,2,8,82,92,1.1304347826086956,0.041523171204257234,539,He is the master when it comes to thermals.
3542,2,8,82,92,1.1304347826086956,0.041523171204257234,539,"C'mon Gary, it was 15 years ago. Stop being so dramatic!"
3542,4,4,84,92,1.1304347826086956,0.04692501287519052,539,"Nobody will see this caption, so... FART FART FART FART!"

3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,Okay - this calls for a decision.
3542,2,8,82,92,1.1304347826086956,0.041523171204257234,539,He has always had sticky feet.
3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,"Next time I see an email with a subject line about crowdfunding anti-gravity shoes, I just might open it."
3542,2,8,82,92,1.1304347826086956,0.041523171204257234,539,watch your step its slippery down there
3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,Jesus and his water-walking got nothing on this guy...
3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,"Okay, we give, Richard. Nobody's trekking pole hangs lower than yours."
3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,We all thought he couldn't do it...
3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,Magneto shoes were the right choice for the Iron Mountain hike.
3542,2,8,82,92,1.1304347826086956,0.041523171204257234,539,"I do have faith, I am only wondering why we are not falling backwards."
3542,3,6,83,92,1.1304347826086956,0.0443064926404407,539,"""Actually, he's scaling down everything in his life."" [Note: ""everything"" should be underlined]"

3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,These novice hikers don't even know which way is up.
3542,3,6,83,92,1.1304347826086956,0.0443064926404407,539,Soon he'll be running on the Libertarian ticket.
3542,2,8,82,92,1.1304347826086956,0.041523171204257234,539,He's being over dramatic in his impression of how 2016 is going
3542,2,8,82,92,1.1304347826086956,0.041523171204257234,539,He was always very impatient.
3542,2,8,82,92,1.1304347826086956,0.041523171204257234,539,Just when I felt accomplished doing a strenuous hike.
3542,2,8,82,92,1.1304347826086956,0.041523171204257234,539,Rotate right.
3542,2,8,82,92,1.1304347826086956,0.041523171204257234,539,Quit showing off Billy!
3542,2,8,82,92,1.1304347826086956,0.041523171204257234,539,"Ignore him, he's an antigravity show off"
3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,I knew he'd be too scared of heights.
3542,2,8,82,92,1.1304347826086956,0.041523171204257234,539,It's what lemmings would do if they could.
3542,4,4,84,92,1.1304347826086956,0.04692501287519052,539,I should grow a beard
3542,0,12,80,92,1.1304347826086956,0.035304258388745666,539,He is trying to prove Newton was wrong!
3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,Jeremy always wanted to live in a perpendicular universe.
3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,He's taking the shortcut!
3542,3,6,83,92,1.1304347826086956,0.0443064926404407,539,Fred has become insufferable every since he climbed the Matterhorn.
3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,Wish I'd thought of that!
3542,3,6,83,92,1.1304347826086956,0.0443064926404407,539,Why yes he was a Navy Seal.
3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,I still say it's safer to take the Uber Drone back to camp
3542,2,8,82,92,1.1304347826086956,0.041523171204257234,539,"He's been telling me he was a fly, but I thought he was just off his meds again."
3542,0,12,80,92,1.1304347826086956,0.035304258388745666,539,Where's Waldo?

3542,2,8,82,92,1.1304347826086956,0.041523171204257234,539,Last time we get Peter Parker as a guide.
3542,2,8,82,92,1.1304347826086956,0.041523171204257234,539,Shall we drop him your apple ?
3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,I made him an offer he couldn't refuse.
3542,0,12,80,92,1.1304347826086956,0.035304258388745666,539,He's always been a bit off.
3542,2,8,82,92,1.1304347826086956,0.041523171204257234,539,Can he walk on water?

3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,He has no fear of the law.
3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,President Trump has repealed the law of gravity.
3542,2,8,82,92,1.1304347826086956,0.041523171204257234,539,He swears that's a great cure for acrophobia.
3542,2,8,82,92,1.1304347826086956,0.041523171204257234,539,"Hold on a minute Joe! Goin' down is one thing-remember, you have to come back up!"
3542,1,10,81,92,1.1304347826086956,0.038539359149039935,539,He's lost his bearings.
3542,3,6,83,92,1.1304347826086956,0.0443064926404407,539,"I thought he was muttering that stupid meme about the ""box"", but it was really about ""thinking outside the rocks""!"

3663,3,6,84,93,1.1290322580645162,0.04384992482710654,539,He said he could show me a unique opportunity
3663,2,8,83,93,1.1290322580645162,0.04109819724326491,539,"When you get to the bottom, don't forget to secure the rope before you throw it up throw up."
3663,3,6,84,93,1.1290322580645162,0.04384992482710654,539,Guess he finally decided to build that stairway to heaven.
