1325,5,21,103,129,1.2403100775193798,0.04507636957214343,537,It's going on the wall in his man-cave.
1325,8,15,106,129,1.2403100775193798,0.048941303485172054,537,"Please don't get him started, this is day three of ""totally going paleo""."
1325,5,21,103,129,1.2403100775193798,0.04507636957214343,537,"Oh, he is trying to reinvent the wheel, but what bothers me is his dragging me around by the hair."
1325,8,15,106,129,1.2403100775193798,0.048941303485172054,537,He's an inventor. Right now he is working on something he calls 'fire'.
1325,7,17,105,129,1.2403100775193798,0.04768780929986155,537,If he's going to propose; it'd better be a big ring
1325,8,15,106,129,1.2403100775193798,0.048941303485172054,537,I guess I didn't really understand what he meant by 'working on the Big O'.
1325,6,19,104,129,1.2403100775193798,0.04640046470470108,537,He's constantly reinventing the wheel

1325,5,21,103,129,1.2403100775193798,0.04507636957214343,537,Yeah...Stanley's been staring at that thing for 5 days straight...he says he's going to fool Penn and Teller with some trick he's working on.
1325,10,11,108,129,1.2403100775193798,0.051356589147286816,537,"Honey, I think you ordered the wrong size diaphragm."
1325,7,17,105,129,1.2403100775193798,0.04768780929986155,537,He's been trying to make a hole in one for years.
1325,7,17,105,129,1.2403100775193798,0.04768780929986155,537,"He says he came up with ""The Clapper"" as well"
1325,5,21,103,129,1.2403100775193798,0.04507636957214343,537,Only three more to go!

1325,6,19,104,129,1.2403100775193798,0.04640046470470108,537,"Well, it started when John got into the whole Paleo diet thing."
1325,6,19,104,129,1.2403100775193798,0.04640046470470108,537,He's been happier since he got his mancave
1325,5,21,103,129,1.2403100775193798,0.04507636957214343,537,It's his new startup.
1325,5,21,103,129,1.2403100775193798,0.04507636957214343,537,It's a 'no-flat'.
1325,4,23,102,129,1.2403100775193798,0.043712184374573484,537,"For our anniversary, Bob said he would get me a new ring."
1325,4,23,102,129,1.2403100775193798,0.043712184374573484,537,"The wheel? Oh, you should see him with fire."
1325,5,21,103,129,1.2403100775193798,0.04507636957214343,537,"He calls it ""the wheel."" Thinks it could be big..."
1325,6,19,104,129,1.2403100775193798,0.04640046470470108,537,"Now that he's reinvented it, he doesn't know what to do with it."
1325,7,17,105,129,1.2403100775193798,0.04768780929986155,537,"I tell him to fix the table, and he reinvents the wheel"
1325,4,23,102,129,1.2403100775193798,0.043712184374573484,537,"When I told him he needed to reinvent, I meant himself."
1325,4,23,102,129,1.2403100775193798,0.043712184374573484,537,"Next he's going to reinvent sliced bread, and then it's off to build a better mousetrap."
1325,8,15,106,129,1.2403100775193798,0.048941303485172054,537,He's retired now and using his Art History Degree?
1325,4,23,102,129,1.2403100775193798,0.043712184374573484,537,I'm starting to regret encouraging him.
1325,9,13,107,129,1.2403100775193798,0.05016348490521234,537,I told him I haven't had the Big O in quite a while.

1325,3,25,101,129,1.2403100775193798,0.04230403091655634,537,The One is in the garage. He thinks he invented the computer.
1325,6,19,104,129,1.2403100775193798,0.04640046470470108,537,"Oh, I know. Last week, Harold reinvented indoor plumbing."
1325,5,21,103,129,1.2403100775193798,0.04507636957214343,537,Don't tell me ... He has a glazed expression!
1325,6,19,104,129,1.2403100775193798,0.04640046470470108,537,George is clueless when it comes to 'The Big O.'
1325,4,23,102,129,1.2403100775193798,0.043712184374573484,537,He has been working on it ever since I told him he never has an original idea.
1325,7,17,105,129,1.2403100775193798,0.04768780929986155,537,"I told him, ""You don't have to reinvent the wheel"" but he never listens to me."

1325,3,25,101,129,1.2403100775193798,0.04230403091655634,537,"He thinks he close to solving the ""gathers no moss"" problem."
1325,3,25,101,129,1.2403100775193798,0.04230403091655634,537,...and then I'm supposed to rat my hair and get naked on a bear skin rug
1325,5,21,103,129,1.2403100775193798,0.04507636957214343,537,"After Ernie's big success last month with fire, he's been totally focused on this new project."
1325,4,23,102,129,1.2403100775193798,0.043712184374573484,537,Bill's finally given up on reinventing himself.
1325,8,15,106,129,1.2403100775193798,0.048941303485172054,537,He is still baffled that nobody cares
1325,5,21,103,129,1.2403100775193798,0.04507636957214343,537,You should see how excited he gets when I turn the stove on to make dinner.
1325,4,23,102,129,1.2403100775193798,0.043712184374573484,537,Bert has been dropping subtle hints about not wanting children.
1325,6,19,104,129,1.2403100775193798,0.04640046470470108,537,He just bought a new washer for our grist mill.
1325,6,19,104,129,1.2403100775193798,0.04640046470470108,537,He went to an innovation conference last week. I don't have the heart to tell him.
1325,8,15,106,129,1.2403100775193798,0.048941303485172054,537,"I told him not to reinvent the wheel. As usual, he didn't listen."
1325,4,23,102,129,1.2403100775193798,0.043712184374573484,537,"""He almost choked on a lifesaver when he was five and is still trying to master his anxiety""."

1325,5,21,103,129,1.2403100775193798,0.04507636957214343,537,"His problem now is whether to call his style ""Re-Invention"" or ""Neo-Wheelism."
1325,5,21,103,129,1.2403100775193798,0.04507636957214343,537,He's such a Neanderthal.
1325,5,21,103,129,1.2403100775193798,0.04507636957214343,537,He's convinced that PaleoTech will be the next big thing.
1325,3,25,101,129,1.2403100775193798,0.04230403091655634,537,He's trying to capture the concept of nothingness.
1420,4,22,102,128,1.234375,0.0436470597159808,537,Tom is going back to fundamentals.
1420,5,20,103,128,1.234375,0.04503440149389559,537,I think he's getting ready to pop the question!
1420,6,18,104,128,1.234375,0.04638026319434138,537,"""Forget everything that came before"", his instructor said."
1420,7,16,105,128,1.234375,0.04768815691594056,537,But first he had to deconstruct it.
1420,4,22,102,128,1.234375,0.0436470597159808,537,"No idea. He calls it a ""wheel""."
1420,4,22,102,128,1.234375,0.0436470597159808,537,But then we stopped arguing about it. We were just going round and round.
1420,5,20,103,128,1.234375,0.04503440149389559,537,"Little did Dave know, as soon as he had achieved what women asked for, they would no longer be interested."
1420,4,22,102,128,1.234375,0.0436470597159808,537,And by God if he doesn't fancy himself some sort of inventor.
1420,9,12,107,128,1.234375,0.050201825685579946,537,Otto is from Ohio.
1420,6,18,104,128,1.234375,0.04638026319434138,537,He tires easily.
1420,5,20,103,128,1.234375,0.04503440149389559,537,Rick's very literal about his man-cave.
1420,10,10,108,128,1.234375,0.051412593770673996,537,"Well, you know men."
1420,5,20,103,128,1.234375,0.04503440149389559,537,Reinvention is the key to our relationship.
1420,5,20,103,128,1.234375,0.04503440149389559,537,He started out with a perfect square and now look at it.
1420,4,22,102,128,1.234375,0.0436470597159808,537,Earle sees his retirement as a time for reinvention.
1420,5,20,103,128,1.234375,0.04503440149389559,537,Would you like a donut? I think there's one left.
1420,6,18,104,128,1.234375,0.04638026319434138,537,I don't think it will ever get off the ground.
1420,3,24,101,128,1.234375,0.04221414840770096,537,Doug always has to figure things out for himself.
1420,9,12,107,128,1.234375,0.050201825685579946,537,"He said I was a millstone around he's neck,so I got him one to try just to remind him how lucky he is to have me, and if he complains anymore he will be getting a headstone."
1420,5,20,103,128,1.234375,0.04503440149389559,537,He's been totally obsessed since he went on that paleo diet.
1420,6,18,104,128,1.234375,0.04638026319434138,537,Three days of staring and he still can't figure out where to put the air valve.
1420,4,22,102,128,1.234375,0.0436470597159808,537,"I put in a new subscription for ""The Rolling Stone."" Can't wait till it gets here."
1420,5,20,103,128,1.234375,0.04503440149389559,537,He's in there capturing my essence.
1420,5,20,103,128,1.234375,0.04503440149389559,537,The truck has a flat.
1420,4,22,102,128,1.234375,0.0436470597159808,537,Last week it was fire. This week . . .
1420,6,18,104,128,1.234375,0.04638026319434138,537,He's working on the bagel donut paradox.
1420,8,14,106,128,1.234375,0.04896112545788099,537,I mentioned to him that I'd like to have one.
1420,5,20,103,128,1.234375,0.04503440149389559,537,Actually what I said was-you should try and re-invent yourself.
1420,5,20,103,128,1.234375,0.04503440149389559,537,He's calling it 'the best thing since sliced bread!'
1420,5,20,103,128,1.234375,0.04503440149389559,537,Bob and I have decided to start over.
1420,5,20,103,128,1.234375,0.04503440149389559,537,"I keep telling him, ""you don't have to reinvent the wheel"", but does he listen?"
1420,5,20,103,128,1.234375,0.04503440149389559,537,He's determined to have a bigger number on the driveway than the neighbors'.
1420,5,20,103,128,1.234375,0.04503440149389559,537,"My husband thinks he's invented the ""Big O""."
1420,6,18,104,128,1.234375,0.04638026319434138,537,He's really gotten into reinventing.
1420,5,20,103,128,1.234375,0.04503440149389559,537,What was you're maiden name before Flintstone?
1420,7,16,105,128,1.234375,0.04768815691594056,537,"He said, ""I want to be a sculptor"", and I said, ""...Oh?"""
1420,3,24,101,128,1.234375,0.04221414840770096,537,Shhhh. He thinks he invented it.
1420,6,18,104,128,1.234375,0.04638026319434138,537,It's been like this since he got on that paleo diet.
1420,4,22,102,128,1.234375,0.0436470597159808,537,He never tries to understand me....I said I need a washer for a big load.
1420,5,20,103,128,1.234375,0.04503440149389559,537,"He says that when we retire to the South Pacific, we'll be rich."
1420,5,20,103,128,1.234375,0.04503440149389559,537,"I kept telling him I was waiting for him to give me the big ""O"". Now he doesn't understand why I don't like it."
1420,7,16,105,128,1.234375,0.04768815691594056,537,"So what's your husband up to tonight, discovering fire?"
1420,8,14,106,128,1.234375,0.04896112545788099,537,It's certainly not how I expected Phil to spend time in his man cave.
1420,5,20,103,128,1.234375,0.04503440149389559,537,He hasn't let us see it yet.. but he is pretty sure he can get a patent on it!
1420,5,20,103,128,1.234375,0.04503440149389559,537,He won't read instructions; he insists on reinventing the wheel
1420,5,20,103,128,1.234375,0.04503440149389559,537,He's finished the coffee cup already.
1420,4,22,102,128,1.234375,0.0436470597159808,537,"Well once it gets rolling, he claims it won't gather any moss."
1420,3,24,101,128,1.234375,0.04221414840770096,537,It's for the wall of his man cave.
1420,6,18,104,128,1.234375,0.04638026319434138,537,Maybe next he'll reinvent the romance in our relationship.

1622,5,18,102,125,1.224,0.045243427610377675,537,I told him that I'm still waiting for him to give me the 'big O'.
1622,5,18,102,125,1.224,0.045243427610377675,537,Next he wants to reinvent himself.
1622,8,12,105,125,1.224,0.049336239379679445,537,He'll look for a job when he's done reinventing the wheel...
1622,4,20,101,125,1.224,0.04379424030475889,537,It's for his retro man cave.
1622,5,18,102,125,1.224,0.045243427610377675,537,Sid's spare tire is really an embarrassment to him.
1622,6,16,103,125,1.224,0.04664761515876241,537,Maybe next time you have him reinvent the downstairs bathroom.
1622,3,22,100,125,1.224,0.04229542795393436,537,It's his magnum O.
1622,9,10,106,125,1.224,0.05062703600047656,537,I now regret saying he could have a man cave.
1622,6,16,103,125,1.224,0.04664761515876241,537,"I know! Been done before, right?"
1622,7,14,104,125,1.224,0.04801075148406361,537,His hobby is a real lifesaver.
1622,5,18,102,125,1.224,0.045243427610377675,537,Fred has been doing cartwheels since he retired.
1622,2,24,99,125,1.224,0.04074151405804571,537,It's less re-invention and more re-branding.
1622,2,24,99,125,1.224,0.04074151405804571,537,The front pathway is overgrown with moss and so he's eager to put the old proverb to the test.
1622,7,14,104,125,1.224,0.04801075148406361,537,Imagine Harold's disappointment learning someone else holds the original patent.

1622,3,22,100,125,1.224,0.04229542795393436,537,He's finally clearing out his man cave.
1622,5,18,102,125,1.224,0.045243427610377675,537,Harry is re-tiring.
1622,6,16,103,125,1.224,0.04664761515876241,537,"I told him that saving our marriage wasn't like reinventing the wheel but, of course, he disagreed."
1622,4,20,101,125,1.224,0.04379424030475889,537,We've decided on a primitive look for the living room.
1622,6,16,103,125,1.224,0.04664761515876241,537,He said the idea came to him this morning at Dunkin' Donuts.
1622,5,18,102,125,1.224,0.045243427610377675,537,Harold believes he has really hit on something big this time
1622,7,14,104,125,1.224,0.04801075148406361,537,"I know, he's an auto mechanic, but he has this completely different artistic side."
1622,8,12,105,125,1.224,0.049336239379679445,537,"I asked for the big 'O', so he went and grabbed his tools."
1622,5,18,102,125,1.224,0.045243427610377675,537,Well...he's working on other things too.
1622,6,16,103,125,1.224,0.04664761515876241,537,I'm going to sell it on E-Bay so I don't have to find a place for it.
1622,2,24,99,125,1.224,0.04074151405804571,537,"""He keeps muttering 'Back to the good old days'."
1622,6,16,103,125,1.224,0.04664761515876241,537,He sets sail for the new world next week!

3742,3,7,90,100,1.13,0.04181488788081165,537,It's a piece for Tim Hortons.
3742,1,11,88,100,1.13,0.036666666666666674,537,It was his specialty as a congressional staffer.
3742,1,11,88,100,1.13,0.036666666666666674,537,"He thinks he's building a better mouse trap, but to me it feels like he's just reinventing the wheel."
3742,1,11,88,100,1.13,0.036666666666666674,537,He adores reinventing.
3742,3,7,90,100,1.13,0.04181488788081165,537,Will he be spelling all of George Carlin's seven words?
3742,2,9,89,100,1.13,0.03932511470376974,537,He's thinking about cutting it in half so he can apply for a patent!
3742,0,13,87,100,1.13,0.033799766898963114,537,John's been getting into the prehistoric movement.
3742,1,11,88,100,1.13,0.036666666666666674,537,This cronut thing is getting out of hand.
3742,2,9,89,100,1.13,0.03932511470376974,537,He's trying to reinvent the wheel...again.
3742,1,11,88,100,1.13,0.036666666666666674,537,Apparently it's a new part of this Paleo diet thing he's doing.
3742,0,13,87,100,1.13,0.033799766898963114,537,Herbert has moved on from reinventing himself.
3742,1,11,88,100,1.13,0.036666666666666674,537,"Oy, always reinventing the wheel that one..."
3742,3,7,90,100,1.13,0.04181488788081165,537,"It's not perfect yet, but it's leaps above his last invention: fire."
3742,4,5,91,100,1.13,0.044164522532288863,537,I decided not to tell him that someone has already invented the wheel.
3742,1,11,88,100,1.13,0.036666666666666674,537,These two chairs are uncomfortably situated.
3742,0,13,87,100,1.13,0.033799766898963114,537,"Since his retirement, Bob has been reinventing things."
3742,3,7,90,100,1.13,0.04181488788081165,537,...and next week I'm going to try to make biscuits.
3742,2,9,89,100,1.13,0.03932511470376974,537,He calls it his 'Chordless Stone.'
3742,3,7,90,100,1.13,0.04181488788081165,537,"Yeah, I got it on sale. I'm not sure where he's going to put it."
3742,4,5,91,100,1.13,0.044164522532288863,537,He's working on his next big statue: The Tinkler.
3742,0,13,87,100,1.13,0.033799766898963114,537,He never has been one to follow proverbial sayings.
3742,2,9,89,100,1.13,0.03932511470376974,537,That's George once more entering the invention of the month contest.
3742,2,9,89,100,1.13,0.03932511470376974,537,This isn't what I meant when I told him that healthy living goes beyond his paleo diet.
3742,2,9,89,100,1.13,0.03932511470376974,537,He always thinks he is reinventing the wheel.
3742,3,7,90,100,1.13,0.04181488788081165,537,Good for her. My Jack has decided not to enter the science fair this year.
3742,2,9,89,100,1.13,0.03932511470376974,537,He actually has reinvented the wheel.
3742,2,9,89,100,1.13,0.03932511470376974,537,Jim's busy working on his car.
3742,3,7,90,100,1.13,0.04181488788081165,537,I told us you I married a big nut.
3742,1,11,88,100,1.13,0.036666666666666674,537,Frank is all about reinvention these days.
3742,3,7,90,100,1.13,0.04181488788081165,537,So he reinvented it. I'm no telling him.
3742,1,11,88,100,1.13,0.036666666666666674,537,Oh yes! Viktor's always trying to build the 'next big thing.'
3742,2,9,89,100,1.13,0.03932511470376974,537,It's our Yap retirement fund.
3742,1,11,88,100,1.13,0.036666666666666674,537,Sorry about the banging. He's reinventing again.
3742,1,11,88,100,1.13,0.036666666666666674,537,"When he first quit his job to follow his passion, I was supportive. But, for the last six months, all he's done is reinvent things."
3742,1,11,88,100,1.13,0.036666666666666674,537,"It's a commission from Daniel Dunkin,, the guy who started Dunkin' Donuts."
3742,3,7,90,100,1.13,0.04181488788081165,537,I just wish he would stop reinventing the wheel.
3742,2,9,89,100,1.13,0.03932511470376974,537,Claude is a reinventor.
3742,0,13,87,100,1.13,0.033799766898963114,537,It's his spare time.
3742,2,9,89,100,1.13,0.03932511470376974,537,"Thag, sweetheart, could you whip us up some fire or something and warm up our drinks?"
3742,3,7,90,100,1.13,0.04181488788081165,537,I think auto-suggestion therapy is exactly the right starting point.
3742,0,13,87,100,1.13,0.033799766898963114,537,I told him to work it out himself.
3742,1,11,88,100,1.13,0.036666666666666674,537,"Well, he tried, but it is the same old wheel."
3742,3,7,90,100,1.13,0.04181488788081165,537,That's the last time we take separate vacations.
3742,3,7,90,100,1.13,0.04181488788081165,537,"Henry said he was just running to buy some nuts and bolts, but I guess he bought us a brand new washer too!"
3742,3,7,90,100,1.13,0.04181488788081165,537,He read about this Cheese Wheel Rolling competition they have in England
3742,2,9,89,100,1.13,0.03932511470376974,537,Dont mind him; he's he's in a mood to re-invent.
3742,3,7,90,100,1.13,0.04181488788081165,537,He calls himself The Reinventor.
3742,3,7,90,100,1.13,0.04181488788081165,537,"You know my husband, he just loves reinventing the wheel."
3742,1,11,88,100,1.13,0.036666666666666674,537,He thinks he can re-invent the wheel in his man cave.
3742,2,9,89,100,1.13,0.03932511470376974,537,Does he really think he can reinvent the wheel?
3742,4,5,91,100,1.13,0.044164522532288863,537,"Don't laugh, but he rode his bicycle to buy the chisel."
3742,1,11,88,100,1.13,0.036666666666666674,537,We've gone round and round about this and he still wants to reinvent the wheel.
3742,3,7,90,100,1.13,0.04181488788081165,537,And I thought cronuts were the next big thing.
3742,2,9,89,100,1.13,0.03932511470376974,537,Have you tried venturing outside of your wheelhouse?
3742,1,11,88,100,1.13,0.036666666666666674,537,"No, the backyard chicken coop didn't work out. Now we're into artisanal tires."
3742,2,9,89,100,1.13,0.03932511470376974,537,Mike's on to something.
3742,1,11,88,100,1.13,0.036666666666666674,537,"Don't worry mom, he said he has big plans for our future."
3742,0,13,87,100,1.13,0.033799766898963114,537,Wait 'till he sees the other part!
3742,4,5,91,100,1.13,0.044164522532288863,537,He thought he was being so creative...
3742,3,7,90,100,1.13,0.04181488788081165,537,He's reinventing the man cave.
3742,3,7,90,100,1.13,0.04181488788081165,537,He can't see the donut for the hole.
3742,2,9,89,100,1.13,0.03932511470376974,537,"On the other hand, he did study reinventing in college."
3742,1,11,88,100,1.13,0.036666666666666674,537,"No Mother, Tom has never clubbed or drug me by my hair to see his latest creation in his man cave."
3742,2,9,89,100,1.13,0.03932511470376974,537,"He's building a wishing well. It should be ready by Tuesday, November 8."" ""That's as good as anything else, I guess."
3742,2,9,89,100,1.13,0.03932511470376974,537,He's a re-inventer. Last week it was a spear.
3742,1,11,88,100,1.13,0.036666666666666674,537,"Oh No, he's definitely not the alpha male type."
3742,2,9,89,100,1.13,0.03932511470376974,537,He's been at it for weeks. Another one of his cockamamie ideas that won't amount to anything.
3742,1,11,88,100,1.13,0.036666666666666674,537,The basalt really ties the room together.
3742,1,11,88,100,1.13,0.036666666666666674,537,He's been working on it ever since since Ancestor.com said the inventor is his ancestor.
3742,0,13,87,100,1.13,0.033799766898963114,537,He's been in there for hours trying to reinvent it.
3742,2,9,89,100,1.13,0.03932511470376974,537,He says he's trying to reinvent himself.
3742,1,11,88,100,1.13,0.036666666666666674,537,He's working on an APP that will change everything
3742,2,9,89,100,1.13,0.03932511470376974,537,He takes Vision Zero too literally
3742,2,9,89,100,1.13,0.03932511470376974,537,His little projects always end up taking so much longer than he expected.
3742,2,9,89,100,1.13,0.03932511470376974,537,"Every day since, he has been trying to reinvent the wheel, its a vicious circle."
3742,4,5,91,100,1.13,0.044164522532288863,537,It's for his monster truck...T-Rex.
3742,0,13,87,100,1.13,0.033799766898963114,537,It's a perfect counterfeit- but shipping them to the Yap Islands really cuts into the profit...
3742,1,11,88,100,1.13,0.036666666666666674,537,"Just ignore him, he is going through a cliche hipster phase."
3742,3,7,90,100,1.13,0.04181488788081165,537,He's determined to reinvent the wheel.
3742,4,5,91,100,1.13,0.044164522532288863,537,"Fire, lever, electricity....you name it, he's claimed he invented it"
3742,3,7,90,100,1.13,0.04181488788081165,537,I stupidly took him to a George Rickey exhibit when we were in DC...
3742,4,5,91,100,1.13,0.044164522532288863,537,The doctor told Dave he could eat one cookie per day and still lose weight so I am not sure what went wrong with his diet!
3742,2,9,89,100,1.13,0.03932511470376974,537,The BFG spilled his cereal again.
3742,1,11,88,100,1.13,0.036666666666666674,537,What can I say....some people DO want to reinvent the wheel.
3742,2,9,89,100,1.13,0.03932511470376974,537,We're lucky that he hasn't reinvented the axle yet.
3742,2,9,89,100,1.13,0.03932511470376974,537,"He takes the term ""man cave"" literally."
3742,1,11,88,100,1.13,0.036666666666666674,537,He likes to think of himself as a reinventor.
3742,2,9,89,100,1.13,0.03932511470376974,537,His latest thing is reinventing.
3742,2,9,89,100,1.13,0.03932511470376974,537,He calls it a work in progress.
3742,1,11,88,100,1.13,0.036666666666666674,537,The Hulk should never try to put together IKEA when he's angry
3742,0,13,87,100,1.13,0.033799766898963114,537,His doctor suggested he reinvent himself.
3742,1,11,88,100,1.13,0.036666666666666674,537,"Oh that's just Bill, he works out of his home office. He's a reinventor."
3878,2,9,90,101,1.1287128712871286,0.03895508034238811,537,Frank is reinventing the wheel.
3878,2,9,90,101,1.1287128712871286,0.03895508034238811,537,Mr Eco-friendly here cut it out with a high octane thermal lance.
3878,1,11,89,101,1.1287128712871286,0.03632462639177056,537,He stares at it and I'm saved the nightly interruption. More tea?
3881,1,11,90,102,1.1274509803921569,0.03598886944632537,537,He's working on reinventing himself.
3882,2,9,93,104,1.125,0.03788543517838634,537,He thinks he's a big wheel.
3883,0,12,86,98,1.1224489795918366,0.03328341697069117,537,He much happier now that he's in his wheelhouse.
3883,3,6,89,98,1.1224489795918366,0.0417009130885561,537,His friend Fred Flintstone gave him the idea.
3883,0,12,86,98,1.1224489795918366,0.03328341697069117,537,An oversized LifeSaver raises so many unintended questions.
3883,1,10,87,98,1.1224489795918366,0.03630673878179777,537,He's filled up the garage and the basement with them and now he's making them here.
3883,1,10,87,98,1.1224489795918366,0.03630673878179777,537,"He absolutely insists on an artisanal, gluten-free spare tire."
3883,1,10,87,98,1.1224489795918366,0.03630673878179777,537,"I told him not to reinvent it, but he swears that his version is novel!"
3883,2,8,88,98,1.1224489795918366,0.039096965568884035,537,I hate my architect. He acts as if he's reinventing the wheel.
3883,0,12,86,98,1.1224489795918366,0.03328341697069117,537,He's trying to reinvent the doughnut.
3883,2,8,88,98,1.1224489795918366,0.039096965568884035,537,He can't decide if it will be a plain or sugar coated donut.
3883,1,10,87,98,1.1224489795918366,0.03630673878179777,537,When Armando had the studio we never saw each other. Now he still doesn't see me but I do see quite a lot of him.
3883,0,12,86,98,1.1224489795918366,0.03328341697069117,537,It is a compatible relationship with him. They are both tired all the time.
3883,0,12,86,98,1.1224489795918366,0.03328341697069117,537,"He's just redecorating the dining room, not reinventing the wheel."
3883,0,12,86,98,1.1224489795918366,0.03328341697069117,537,Phil was wrong in thinking that the success of the Star Wars sequels showed that there would be widespread acclamation for his re-invention of the wheel.
3883,2,8,88,98,1.1224489795918366,0.039096965568884035,537,"He stared wistfully at the giant stone wheel as his wife discussed the finer points of aquatic dancing with her childhood friend, Celeste."
3883,1,10,87,98,1.1224489795918366,0.03630673878179777,537,He hopes I'm impressed that he finally made big wheel.
3883,1,10,87,98,1.1224489795918366,0.03630673878179777,537,"It's true, my husband is a big wheel."
3883,4,4,90,98,1.1224489795918366,0.0441515524998172,537,Leave it to men to reinvent the wheel.
3883,2,8,88,98,1.1224489795918366,0.039096965568884035,537,I'm worried he's taking the paleo diet to another level.
3883,1,10,87,98,1.1224489795918366,0.03630673878179777,537,I told him I like donuts.

3883,1,10,87,98,1.1224489795918366,0.03630673878179777,537,"Actually, I told him it would be nice if he were more sculpted."
3883,3,6,89,98,1.1224489795918366,0.0417009130885561,537,I love him -- so can you tell him the wheel has already been invented?
