458,8,22,62,92,1.4130434782608696,0.06764090761126546,546,Definitely dolphins. Porpoises lack the capacity to mock in groups.

481,9,19,63,91,1.4065934065934067,0.06984724651459649,546,At least the sharks don't mock us.

513,10,16,64,90,1.4,0.07206599832692549,546,Do you sometimes see things that aren't there? Or are dolphins just assholes?
513,4,28,58,90,1.4,0.060789643641268855,546,I think our time on the island has made me see things differently.
513,10,16,64,90,1.4,0.07206599832692549,546,"I knew they were smart, but I didn't think them capable of mockery."

513,9,18,63,90,1.4,0.07031230493106523,546,I think it's photoshopped.
513,6,24,60,90,1.4,0.06476694028829148,546,They're not going to leave until we applaud.
513,12,12,66,90,1.4,0.075451202078768,546,There's something fishy about the new neighbors.

513,5,26,59,90,1.4,0.06280978159625925,546,They must think we're talent scouts for Sea World.
513,9,18,63,90,1.4,0.07031230493106523,546,They took gold in Rio
513,6,24,60,90,1.4,0.06476694028829148,546,"I mean seriously, you have to see this!"
513,8,20,62,90,1.4,0.06851373829081123,546,Are they being cruel or just highly communicative?
513,8,20,62,90,1.4,0.06851373829081123,546,Why is this the best form of flattery?
513,6,24,60,90,1.4,0.06476694028829148,546,I saw this show at the Bellagio.
513,5,26,59,90,1.4,0.06280978159625925,546,It would really be impressive if they moved west and gave us some shade.
513,7,22,61,90,1.4,0.06666666666666667,546,He has your nose.
513,8,20,62,90,1.4,0.06851373829081123,546,"Now that I see it, I don't think imitation is the sincerest form of flattery."
513,8,20,62,90,1.4,0.06851373829081123,546,Let me know when they build us a raft.
513,5,26,59,90,1.4,0.06280978159625925,546,"Boy, the one time I really wish I had my camera!"
513,6,24,60,90,1.4,0.06476694028829148,546,No more coconut wine for me.

1515,1,18,52,71,1.2816901408450705,0.05738464447172778,546,This could be the beginning of a meaningful communication or just a spectacular display of flippancy.
1515,4,12,55,71,1.2816901408450705,0.0670838347287272,546,I think they're trying to tell us they understand our plight.
1515,2,16,53,71,1.2816901408450705,0.06078989972082638,546,Are they mocking us porpoisely?
1515,4,12,55,71,1.2816901408450705,0.0670838347287272,546,The absurdity of our situation compels me to question the porpoise of life.
1515,3,14,54,71,1.2816901408450705,0.0640142671206166,546,There's no way this is a coincidence. They have to be doing it on porpoise.

1605,3,13,54,70,1.2714285714285714,0.06409564725042376,546,We'd cream them in Pictionary.
1605,5,9,56,70,1.2714285714285714,0.07025958544104309,546,I think we're their charades clue.
1605,4,11,55,70,1.2714285714285714,0.06724827634518965,546,I promised them an audition at Seaworld when we get home.
1605,6,7,57,70,1.2714285714285714,0.07314703016046158,546,So they haven't gotten help yet... this is still pretty impressive.
1605,5,9,56,70,1.2714285714285714,0.07025958544104309,546,Once they're done mocking us do you think they'll go for help?
1605,2,15,53,70,1.2714285714285714,0.06077971142990491,546,I thought dolphins had feelings.

1605,3,13,54,70,1.2714285714285714,0.06409564725042376,546,Imitation is the sincerest form of mockery.

1605,1,17,52,70,1.2714285714285714,0.05727211054740582,546,I remember SeaWorld when it was just a tank and some beach balls.
1605,3,13,54,70,1.2714285714285714,0.06409564725042376,546,I think they like us ironically.
1605,2,15,53,70,1.2714285714285714,0.06077971142990491,546,Now I know they have always been laughing at us.
1605,3,13,54,70,1.2714285714285714,0.06409564725042376,546,Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery but isn't very helpful.
1605,5,9,56,70,1.2714285714285714,0.07025958544104309,546,I'm flattered by the sincerity of their imitation but flattery gets us nowhere.
1605,5,9,56,70,1.2714285714285714,0.07025958544104309,546,"So, what's their porpoise in mocking us?"
1605,4,11,55,70,1.2714285714285714,0.06724827634518965,546,"Who’s the idiot who said, ‘Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery?’"
1605,1,17,52,70,1.2714285714285714,0.05727211054740582,546,The little one sorta looks like you.
1605,3,13,54,70,1.2714285714285714,0.06409564725042376,546,"Sorry, I was wrong. They aren't rescue dolphins. They are Sea World escapees."
1605,3,13,54,70,1.2714285714285714,0.06409564725042376,546,I'm not feeling sincerely flattered at the moment.
1605,3,13,54,70,1.2714285714285714,0.06409564725042376,546,I do believe they're mocking us on porpoise.
1605,0,19,51,70,1.2714285714285714,0.053535184426749045,546,I was hoping for something more escapist.
1605,4,11,55,70,1.2714285714285714,0.06724827634518965,546,Also the schools are better
1605,3,13,54,70,1.2714285714285714,0.06409564725042376,546,This is not a good time to be a vegan.
1605,3,13,54,70,1.2714285714285714,0.06409564725042376,546,"Yeah, well the top ones are fake."
1605,4,11,55,70,1.2714285714285714,0.06724827634518965,546,It's the sincerest form of flattery
1605,2,15,53,70,1.2714285714285714,0.06077971142990491,546,You should have taught them to catch fish.
1605,4,11,55,70,1.2714285714285714,0.06724827634518965,546,It's the dolphin show promised in the island cruise brochure.
1605,5,9,56,70,1.2714285714285714,0.07025958544104309,546,It's nice they're trying to cheer us up.
1605,2,15,53,70,1.2714285714285714,0.06077971142990491,546,"Stop it, you're projecting."
1605,5,9,56,70,1.2714285714285714,0.07025958544104309,546,They must have escaped from Las Vegas
1605,3,13,54,70,1.2714285714285714,0.06409564725042376,546,Don't look. They're just showing-off.
1605,4,11,55,70,1.2714285714285714,0.06724827634518965,546,"Months of hard work, training the dolphins, finally pays off"
1605,5,9,56,70,1.2714285714285714,0.07025958544104309,546,"Ok, they're mocking us."
1605,3,13,54,70,1.2714285714285714,0.06409564725042376,546,"I can deal with no food and no water, but the incessant mocking....."
1605,5,9,56,70,1.2714285714285714,0.07025958544104309,546,"I can't tell if it's art imitating life, or if they're just ridiculing us."
1605,5,9,56,70,1.2714285714285714,0.07025958544104309,546,They sure are good. It's just a shame they go away every time a rescue boat comes.
1605,4,11,55,70,1.2714285714285714,0.06724827634518965,546,It's life imitating life.

2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,Just what we need....clown dolphins
2092,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,546,Now I think we're about to be victims of identity fraud.
2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,I liked it better when they were doing synchronized swimming.
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,"It's true what they say, dolphins are the most smart-ass animals on the planet."
2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,I think we're going to lose the synchronized swimming contest.
2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,I think they're just making fun of us.
2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,Their idea of camouflage seems a bit fishy.
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,"I don't know, I just feel that they're mocking us somehow."
2092,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,546,We must be dehydrated because I see a fish mirage.
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,They're mimicking us because we have no porpoise in life.
2092,1,13,50,64,1.234375,0.05783026057090191,546,"Coach, we must be near Miami."
2092,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,546,"As they drift by, we'll take out the small one."
2092,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,546,Too soon?
2092,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,546,"Yes, I'm sure they're doing that on porpoise."
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,It's tough keeping up with the Dolphins.
2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,I still say performance art is over-appreciated.
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,I'm not laughing this time—just to prove a point.
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,Is that really what I look like?
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,Our last hope is by going viral on Street View.
2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,"Are they imitating us, or are we imitating them?"
2092,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,546,My turn. What’s more annoying than a Vegas mime troupe?
2092,5,5,54,64,1.234375,0.07299634252361824,546,"I know dolphins are very playful, but now they are just making fun of our little island"
2092,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,546,I guess riding them to shore is out of the question.
2092,1,13,50,64,1.234375,0.05783026057090191,546,"No--I won't turn around for another one of your boring fish stories."" ""No--I won't turn around to hear another of your boring fish stories."
2092,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,546,They think we're going to feed them.
2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,They're showing off again.
2092,1,13,50,64,1.234375,0.05783026057090191,546,Mirror neurons?
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,"I have a feeling that in the next life, I will be working at Sea World."
2092,1,13,50,64,1.234375,0.05783026057090191,546,"It would be sensational, if they weren't so in-your-face about it."
2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,Do you think we'll ever get our act together like that?
2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,"People say dolphins are smart, but I just don't see it."
2092,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,546,"If they're so smart, why do they always resort to mocking humor ?"
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,"Nice show, but I've seen it before."
2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,"As if things weren't bad enough, now they're mocking us."
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,You'd think they'd have better things to do than mock us.
2092,1,13,50,64,1.234375,0.05783026057090191,546,Where's a camera when you need it.
2092,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,546,"They're intelligent enough to mock us, but not to get us off of this god-forsaken island!"
2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,I think you'll see we have a lot in common with the neighbors.
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,Ocean's got talent.
2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,Now they are making fun of us!
2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,"Sit up straight, the neighbors are watching."
2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,Have I ever told you I hate SeaWorld?
2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,"You say they're playful, I say they're making fun of us."
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,"I might be hallucinating, but I think I see a dolphinium."
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,Last week they did Heatherwick's Vessel. Truly stunning.
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,"I know this one. It's right on the tip of my tongue. Oh geez, where is my google when I need it?"
2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,"Mock us as they like, but they're the ones who taste just like chicken."
2092,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,546,"We need leaders, not followers."
2092,1,13,50,64,1.234375,0.05783026057090191,546,"I am shocked by the compassion, the mighty showmanship and too the overwhelming sarcasm"
2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,I do NOT hunch like that.
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,The dolphins are taunting again!
2092,1,13,50,64,1.234375,0.05783026057090191,546,I didn't know a school of fish could literally be an art school of fish.
2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,Do they know that they aren't at SeaWorld anymore?
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,It's times like this that make me wonder if my life has a porpoise.
2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,They're showing off on porpoise!
2092,5,5,54,64,1.234375,0.07299634252361824,546,These Chinese acrobat porpoises are amazing.
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,We have been here too long
2092,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,546,"You're right, maybe we should've gone to Canada."
2092,1,13,50,64,1.234375,0.05783026057090191,546,"I wish Wilson could have lived to see this, too."
2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,"Look, it's the Dolphrey Ballet!"
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,Who knew they did synchronized swimming?
2092,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,546,What were you saying about humans being the smartest mammals?
2092,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,546,Looks fishy to me
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,We never should have mentioned we were trainers.
2092,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,546,Dolphins? Porpoises? Which one would you turn around for?
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,Great. Another troupe of Seaworld escapees.
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,I spy with my little eye...
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,"No, I don't have a tip. So shove off!"
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,"If we had a coconut, I'd throw it at them."
2092,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,546,And now they've made a multi porpoise structure.
2092,1,13,50,64,1.234375,0.05783026057090191,546,A deeper form of flattery would be to damn-well whistle for help!
2092,1,13,50,64,1.234375,0.05783026057090191,546,Highly intelligent? How about a rescue instead of a show!
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,Art imitates reality.
2092,5,5,54,64,1.234375,0.07299634252361824,546,"Ed, I've seen my first mirage. It's an 'Edible Arrangement' of fish."
2092,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,546,Crowdfunding with a porpoise
2092,0,15,49,64,1.234375,0.053369535239372906,546,"Honey, do you think that porpoises are capable of satire?"
2092,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,546,You can stop worrying about food and water--we've died and gone to hell.
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,And you thought your life had no porpoise.
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,Presentation schmesentation... I'm sick of sushi.
2092,1,13,50,64,1.234375,0.05783026057090191,546,"No, I'm fairly certain those are porpoises."
2092,1,13,50,64,1.234375,0.05783026057090191,546,Don't look now but I think they're mocking us again.
2092,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,546,"Quick, make like a cheeseburger!"
2092,1,13,50,64,1.234375,0.05783026057090191,546,Are you mocking me?
2092,0,15,49,64,1.234375,0.053369535239372906,546,I hope they aren't waiting for a tip...
2092,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,546,They're doing that to us on porpoise.
2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,I think a few of them are Second City guys.
2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,"Ahh, the true mockery of captivity..."
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,Care to watch? The dolphin show just started.
2092,1,13,50,64,1.234375,0.05783026057090191,546,Some say mockery is the highest form of flattery.
2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,They've been mocking us for an hour.
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,"Our lives are meaningless without porpoise."""
2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,We're saved. Animal Planet has to be close.
2092,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,546,We have to improve out act.
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,"""We all wish to be what we are not""."
2092,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,546,"Okay, let's find out, once and for all, if these 'people' have any intelligence."
2092,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,546,"So, now we know; it's nature not nurture."
2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,Maybe someday I'll see the one who plays me.
2092,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,546,I bet they do a mean 'Burghers of Calais.'
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,"Big surprise! The dolphin cheerleaders you wished for are here, and they're teasing us."
2092,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,546,Remember when dolphin shaped mailboxes used to annoy you?
2092,1,13,50,64,1.234375,0.05783026057090191,546,Have you ever wondered about an alternate universe?
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,They haven't blinked in days.
2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,"No, I don't want to hear about your idea for a new act at Sea World."
2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,There is a parallel universe!
2092,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,546,Marooned and schooled
2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,Thought you were only suppose to see mirages in the desert?
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,"No, they're dolphinately porpoisely mocking us."
2092,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,546,Are they making fun of us?
2092,5,5,54,64,1.234375,0.07299634252361824,546,"Dolphin see, dolphin do, ha ha"
2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,I've heard of mock turtles but never mocking dolphins!
2092,1,13,50,64,1.234375,0.05783026057090191,546,They've even managed to perfect your slouch of Trump despair this time round.
2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,I hear they're planning to build a wall.
2092,1,13,50,64,1.234375,0.05783026057090191,546,Taunting is so declasse.
2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,There's something fishy about the new neighbors.
2092,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,546,Now they're just doing it on porpoise...
2092,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,546,I even hate dolphin mimes
2092,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,546,They love to show off!
2092,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,546,Those so-called experts are so wrong. Dolphins love to perform.
2092,1,13,50,64,1.234375,0.05783026057090191,546,Convergent evolution is an amazing process.
2092,0,15,49,64,1.234375,0.053369535239372906,546,I know it's the sincerest form of flattery but I would rather they just bring us a sandwich.
2092,6,3,55,64,1.234375,0.07631839730928017,546,It was then that the boys discovered that dolphins had the capability to mimic and cruelly mock humans.
2092,0,15,49,64,1.234375,0.053369535239372906,546,I can't remember -- are they mimics or mimes?
2092,5,5,54,64,1.234375,0.07299634252361824,546,What a bunch of dicks.

3739,1,5,48,54,1.1296296296296295,0.053175186756420724,546,I thought SeaWorld closed down their shows?
3739,0,7,47,54,1.1296296296296295,0.04613879568230499,546,Don't look ... it's the Seaworld Travelling Show ... they'll never leave.
3739,1,5,48,54,1.1296296296296295,0.053175186756420724,546,I don't understand why all tuna isn't dolphin safe
3739,1,5,48,54,1.1296296296296295,0.053175186756420724,546,I think they are doing that on porpoise
3739,0,7,47,54,1.1296296296296295,0.04613879568230499,546,Maybe they have coconuts!!
3739,1,5,48,54,1.1296296296296295,0.053175186756420724,546,Do you click and whistle like a dolphin? Now's the time.
3739,1,5,48,54,1.1296296296296295,0.053175186756420724,546,Doppelganger.
3739,0,7,47,54,1.1296296296296295,0.04613879568230499,546,It's one of those Icelandic public art things.
3739,1,5,48,54,1.1296296296296295,0.053175186756420724,546,There is nothing very entertaing to look at since my cell phone battery ran out of charge
3739,1,5,48,54,1.1296296296296295,0.053175186756420724,546,Does Cirque du Soleil have a dolphin rehabilitation program?
3739,0,7,47,54,1.1296296296296295,0.04613879568230499,546,They finally broke out of the R.I.P formation.
3739,0,7,47,54,1.1296296296296295,0.04613879568230499,546,I wish they'd get closer.
3739,0,7,47,54,1.1296296296296295,0.04613879568230499,546,I never saw this at Seaworld.
3739,1,5,48,54,1.1296296296296295,0.053175186756420724,546,"I know I asked for a flotilla, but this is ridiculous."
3739,0,7,47,54,1.1296296296296295,0.04613879568230499,546,It looks like dinner to me.
3739,0,7,47,54,1.1296296296296295,0.04613879568230499,546,That's one way to spend the time while waiting to be discovered.
3739,3,1,50,54,1.1296296296296295,0.06500172709792945,546,I'm thinkn' seafood for dinner.
3739,1,5,48,54,1.1296296296296295,0.053175186756420724,546,"Oh, great ... Sealand dolphins!"
3739,1,5,48,54,1.1296296296296295,0.053175186756420724,546,Either they're mocking us or practicing for the next Olympic games.
3739,1,5,48,54,1.1296296296296295,0.053175186756420724,546,"We have no choice in the matter, but those two look to be stranded on porpoise."
3739,1,5,48,54,1.1296296296296295,0.053175186756420724,546,Showoffs...they must think were filming Castaway 2.
3739,1,5,48,54,1.1296296296296295,0.053175186756420724,546,I've always suspected dolphins are unreconstructed satiric optimists.
3739,2,3,49,54,1.1296296296296295,0.059383604691421,546,I can tell that we'll grow to like this place.
3739,0,7,47,54,1.1296296296296295,0.04613879568230499,546,At least some of us can swim away.
3739,0,7,47,54,1.1296296296296295,0.04613879568230499,546,I'd prefer sharks.
3739,2,3,49,54,1.1296296296296295,0.059383604691421,546,"If they really want to be helpful, they'd swim out and find someone to rescue us."
3739,1,5,48,54,1.1296296296296295,0.053175186756420724,546,"They'll do whatever I tell them. Cool, huh?"
3739,0,7,47,54,1.1296296296296295,0.04613879568230499,546,Perspective is everything
3739,2,3,49,54,1.1296296296296295,0.059383604691421,546,"Friendly, sure, everyone knows they're friendly. But who ever thought they could be this entertaining?"
3739,1,5,48,54,1.1296296296296295,0.053175186756420724,546,They're known as the Flying Wallendas of synchronized swimming.
3739,0,7,47,54,1.1296296296296295,0.04613879568230499,546,I'm not quite sure they're paying attention.
3739,1,5,48,54,1.1296296296296295,0.053175186756420724,546,Esther Wiliams would be proud...
3739,0,7,47,54,1.1296296296296295,0.04613879568230499,546,So Tres outre and yet banal. Was Jeff Koons here last night?
3739,1,5,48,54,1.1296296296296295,0.053175186756420724,546,"Well, I think I'm seeing a mannequin challenge."
3739,1,5,48,54,1.1296296296296295,0.053175186756420724,546,Assume the formation so they don't notice us!
3739,1,5,48,54,1.1296296296296295,0.053175186756420724,546,I believe they are mocking us as superior life.
3739,1,5,48,54,1.1296296296296295,0.053175186756420724,546,If only they'd learn how to rotate and fan us.
3739,1,5,48,54,1.1296296296296295,0.053175186756420724,546,I'd heard that they were great mimics.
3739,1,5,48,54,1.1296296296296295,0.053175186756420724,546,What porpoise does this serve Marino?
3739,0,7,47,54,1.1296296296296295,0.04613879568230499,546,Didn't an aquatic circus cruise ship get shipwrecked recently?
3739,2,3,49,54,1.1296296296296295,0.059383604691421,546,Now what's wrong!!
3739,1,5,48,54,1.1296296296296295,0.053175186756420724,546,I've never wanted tuna fish so badly in my life.
3739,1,5,48,54,1.1296296296296295,0.053175186756420724,546,Tell them to go back to Sea World!
3739,1,5,48,54,1.1296296296296295,0.053175186756420724,546,At least they didn't go for the family name in gold letters.
3739,2,3,49,54,1.1296296296296295,0.059383604691421,546,I think their making fun of us.
3739,0,7,47,54,1.1296296296296295,0.04613879568230499,546,Don't tell me...you're seeing a dolphin mirage.
3739,1,5,48,54,1.1296296296296295,0.053175186756420724,546,Why would I want to look at something just like this island?
3739,1,5,48,54,1.1296296296296295,0.053175186756420724,546,They're a volunteer group providing entertainment to reduce stress!
3739,1,5,48,54,1.1296296296296295,0.053175186756420724,546,Do you get the feeling that they are mocking us?
3739,1,5,48,54,1.1296296296296295,0.053175186756420724,546,Give them a mackerel and they'll never leave.
3739,1,5,48,54,1.1296296296296295,0.053175186756420724,546,It's deja vu all over again.
3739,1,5,48,54,1.1296296296296295,0.053175186756420724,546,"Conway, someone's making fun of us."
3842,1,5,49,55,1.1272727272727272,0.05225259457122248,546,When pigs fly...
3842,1,5,49,55,1.1272727272727272,0.05225259457122248,546,"Entertaining...? No, I think they are mocking us!"
3842,2,3,50,55,1.1272727272727272,0.05834153162906526,546,Dolphins suck at satire.
3842,1,5,49,55,1.1272727272727272,0.05225259457122248,546,Who knew they'd be so good at truth or dare.
3842,2,3,50,55,1.1272727272727272,0.05834153162906526,546,"bruh, their mocking us."
3842,1,5,49,55,1.1272727272727272,0.05225259457122248,546,You need to shave.
3848,0,7,49,56,1.125,0.04459412925079223,546,Poised for purpose
3848,2,3,51,56,1.125,0.057335309036732875,546,"No, It's got to be a Banksy."
3850,1,5,52,58,1.1206896551724137,0.049666682137193066,546,"Well, I think the whole thing is kinda fishy."
3851,0,7,52,59,1.11864406779661,0.042460458882410665,546,"I think this species is in danger, Ed."
3851,1,5,53,59,1.11864406779661,0.048860455426129414,546,"They’re pantomiming, ‘Global warming will flood your island.’"
3853,1,4,47,52,1.1153846153846154,0.05249323847751087,546,"Jake, is there any porpoise to our life on a desert island?"
3853,0,6,46,52,1.1153846153846154,0.044736922925984586,546,They can even mime.
3853,0,6,46,52,1.1153846153846154,0.044736922925984586,546,"Aren't dolphins clever? They're singing, ""Let Me Entertain You"" from ""Gypsy""."
3853,0,6,46,52,1.1153846153846154,0.044736922925984586,546,Everything is more balanced out here
3853,0,6,46,52,1.1153846153846154,0.044736922925984586,546,Let's see your tap-dance routine.
3853,1,4,47,52,1.1153846153846154,0.05249323847751087,546,Dolphobolus!
3853,0,6,46,52,1.1153846153846154,0.044736922925984586,546,I told you not to drink the salt water again Frank...
3853,0,6,46,52,1.1153846153846154,0.044736922925984586,546,Who says dolphins can't empathize?
3853,0,6,46,52,1.1153846153846154,0.044736922925984586,546,You said you didn't feel challenged anymore.
3853,0,6,46,52,1.1153846153846154,0.044736922925984586,546,"Well, I don't think they're very funny!"
3853,0,6,46,52,1.1153846153846154,0.044736922925984586,546,They must be Parrot Dolphins.
3853,0,6,46,52,1.1153846153846154,0.044736922925984586,546,"Okay, I get it. There is a downside to evolution; but do they have to keep mocking us?"
3853,0,6,46,52,1.1153846153846154,0.044736922925984586,546,They sure jumped through hoops to do that.
3853,0,6,46,52,1.1153846153846154,0.044736922925984586,546,Tarter sauce... Tarter sauce... My kingdom for some tarter sauce...
3853,0,6,46,52,1.1153846153846154,0.044736922925984586,546,"Well, I guess this is the last Dolphin Encounter I'll ever experience."
3853,1,4,47,52,1.1153846153846154,0.05249323847751087,546,What's the porpoise of this?
3853,1,4,47,52,1.1153846153846154,0.05249323847751087,546,Welcome to our full emersion dolphin language class.
3853,2,2,48,52,1.1153846153846154,0.059242618939646566,546,I hope that someone gets my message in a bottlenose.
3853,1,4,47,52,1.1153846153846154,0.05249323847751087,546,"Clear blue undrinkable water, fruitless tree, sun-kissed sand scorching me - I feel nature mocking my plight..."
3853,1,4,47,52,1.1153846153846154,0.05249323847751087,546,"Actually, they're porpoises."
3853,0,6,46,52,1.1153846153846154,0.044736922925984586,546,Ooohhh...Ahhh...
3853,2,2,48,52,1.1153846153846154,0.059242618939646566,546,They claim they started the Mannequin Challenge craze.
3853,1,4,47,52,1.1153846153846154,0.05249323847751087,546,At least they won't starve to death.
3853,0,6,46,52,1.1153846153846154,0.044736922925984586,546,They seem a bit stand-offish
3853,2,2,48,52,1.1153846153846154,0.059242618939646566,546,"""Out here the show comes before the meal...AND THAT'S US!!"
3853,1,4,47,52,1.1153846153846154,0.05249323847751087,546,What do you suppose the porpoise of this is?
3853,1,4,47,52,1.1153846153846154,0.05249323847751087,546,"Five, six, seven, eight! Who do we appreciate?"
3853,0,6,46,52,1.1153846153846154,0.044736922925984586,546,"Mereswine, schmearshine, I wanna see the dancing girls!"
3853,1,4,47,52,1.1153846153846154,0.05249323847751087,546,"On second thought, it could be worse...."
3853,1,4,47,52,1.1153846153846154,0.05249323847751087,546,I think their cartoonist must have taken some crazy improv class.
3853,2,2,48,52,1.1153846153846154,0.059242618939646566,546,Look it's dolphins taking the mannequin challenge!
3853,1,4,47,52,1.1153846153846154,0.05249323847751087,546,"No rescue boat, just those bottlenosed copy-cats again."
3853,2,2,48,52,1.1153846153846154,0.059242618939646566,546,"Hey, Bubba, check out the knockers on these mermaids."
3853,0,6,46,52,1.1153846153846154,0.044736922925984586,546,I think it's an operetta. Is there an HMS Semaphore?
3853,1,4,47,52,1.1153846153846154,0.05249323847751087,546,"Those sperm whale could really use me. You don't mind, do you sweetheart?"
3853,0,6,46,52,1.1153846153846154,0.044736922925984586,546,"Quit worrying so much, we must be close to SeaWorld."
3853,1,4,47,52,1.1153846153846154,0.05249323847751087,546,they are mocking and taunting us
3853,0,6,46,52,1.1153846153846154,0.044736922925984586,546,"Hey Harry, I think there is something fishy going on!"
3853,1,4,47,52,1.1153846153846154,0.05249323847751087,546,We'll tell them we eight dolphins to survive.
3853,0,6,46,52,1.1153846153846154,0.044736922925984586,546,Wait! I've seen this troupe before. In the next act they become a boat and take us to shore.
3853,1,4,47,52,1.1153846153846154,0.05249323847751087,546,Do you think we could do that?
3853,1,4,47,52,1.1153846153846154,0.05249323847751087,546,I sense that they are sympathetic to our situation.
3853,0,6,46,52,1.1153846153846154,0.044736922925984586,546,They are evolving mockery!
3853,1,4,47,52,1.1153846153846154,0.05249323847751087,546,"I can't tell whether those are dolphins, or porpoises."
3853,0,6,46,52,1.1153846153846154,0.044736922925984586,546,"Mirror Mirror of the Sea, who's the prettiest palm tree of them all?"
